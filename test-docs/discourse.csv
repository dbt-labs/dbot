18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","**Note: This post uses Redshift SQL, however the same concept applies to most data warehouses. Check out the notes on BigQuery in the comments below.**

Our dbt project uses some user defined functions (UDFs).
In the past, I've created these UDFs in my SQL console as the superuser, however this isn't ideal as:
* The code was not surfaced as part of our dbt project, so it's unclear what the UDF does
* There was no version control on the UDFs if we needed to update them
* And we weren't maintaining separate development/production versions of the UDFs .

So I decided to put them into our dbt project, using this process:

1. Created a subdirectory, just to keep things tidy: `macros/udfs/`
2. Created a file for each udf, e.g. `macros/udfs/f_future_date.sql` (below). Note that each of my UDFs is prefixed with `f_`, as recommended in the [Redshift documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/udf-naming-udfs.html).
```
{% macro create_f_future_date() %}
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION {{target.schema}}.f_future_date()
RETURNS TIMESTAMP
IMMUTABLE AS $$
SELECT '2100-01-01'::TIMESTAMP;
$$ LANGUAGE sql
{% endmacro %}
```

4. Created a macro called `macros/create_udfs.sql` which calls each UDF macro. Note separation with `;s`. Also, note the inclusion of a `create schema` statement – since the target schema is created after `on-run-start` hooks, and I’ve used the target schema in my UDFs, I have to create that schema if it doesn’t exist.
```
{% macro create_udfs() %}

create schema if not exists {{target.schema}};

{{create_f_list_custom_keys()}};

{{create_f_count_custom_keys()}};

{{create_f_future_date()}}

{% endmacro %}
```
5. Added an `on-run-start` hook to my project
```
on-run-start:
    - '{{create_udfs()}}'
```
6. Updated the references to UDFs in my models to use the schema-versions, e.g.
```
SELECT
{{target.schema}}.F_FUTURE_DATE()
```


Other quirks I ran into when doing this were:
1. As the superuser, I had to grant permission to users to create python udfs:
```
-- as your superuser
GRANT USAGE ON LANGUAGE PLPYTHONU TO userA;
```
2. I _had_ to use schemas because users cannot edit each others’ UDFs (i.e. if `userA` creates the UDF, and `userB` runs the `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` statement, a ""must be owner of function"" error will occur). Using schemas means you are creating distinct UDFs* so won’t hit this issue. I would recommend using schemas anyway to maintain separate dev/production UDFs

\* Assuming each Redshift user profile used by dbt has a distinct target schema.",1
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","I like it!  I think I'll break up my GA post-processing code (which includes a BigQuery javascript UDF) to move the UDFs out like this to keep things appropriately modular.",2
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","@claire So, I think this might be a stupid question, but why use UDFs instead of macros within dbt?",3
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","Not a stupid question at all!
I use UDFs when I need to use python to solve a problem that SQL (or Jinja) can't.
For example, one of our data sources has values stored in JSON keys (🤦), like so:
| json | 
|------| 
| {""known_key"": true, ""custom text"": true, ""more custom text"": true}     | 
| {""known_key"": true, ""even more custom text"": true}     | 

I instead wanted my data like so:
|custom_keys|
|------|
|[""custom text"", ""more custom text""]|
|[""even more custom text""] |
I can't think of how Redshift SQL or Jinja would be able to do the above.
But it's an easy problem to solve using the json python package, so I wrapped it up in a UDF.",4
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","@claire Thanks so much for this post! Great tutorial. Depending on your Redshift config, you may also have to grant permissions to execute the functions you create. I do this with a macro in the post-hook:

    {% for u in user_list %}
      {% for s in schema_list %}
        grant execute on all functions in schema {{ s }} to {{ u }} ;
      {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}",5
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","@claire Are you recreating your production schema every time? If not, I can see 2 issues with this approach.
1. If you change the number of arguments your UDF receives, you will end up with 2 functions with the same name but different arguments (redshift supports method overloading). Not sure this is always the wanted result.
2. If you change the returned type, I believe you will get an error when running the script.

Zeev",6
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","Hey @zeevs
Yup, you're totally right! A significant change in the function is going to break the macro.

I think I played around with including a `DROP FUNCTION` statement in my macro, but if the arguments change, then the statement would return an error (since you'd be trying to DROP a function with different arguments to the one that currently exists).

So I chose that in that case I'd handle it manually. Not perfect, but also not a common scenario thankfully :slight_smile: 

I think best practice here is to drop your production schema regularly, but that's not something that I've implemented",7
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","I guess you could get the definition of all existing udfs from redshift's internal tables and drop all existing udfs, and then run clean create statements for what you need.",8
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","@claire, I adapted your instructions for BQ tonight and it seems one of the BigQuery Persistent UDF limitations is that you cannot define more than one `CREATE FUNCTION` per call. 

This is apparent even by using the BigQuery UI; BQ won't let you execute two CREATE FUNCTION statements in the same query unless they are set as TEMPORARY.

As a result, I don't think it's possible to use a `create_udfs()`-like function for BigQuery since all UDF creation will get compiled and executed in a single call. For example, my error back from `dbt run` is:

`Syntax error: Unexpected extra token CREATE at [7:1]`

I haven't tried it yet, but I suspect calling one macro for each array element of our `dbt_project.yml`'s `on-run-start` hook should solve this, since it will (from my understanding) execute each singular CREATE FUNCTION in it's own BQ request.

I will try it out tmrw!",9
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","@claire et al,

We are able to make BigQuery Persistent UDFs work by adapting your RedShift instructions above. It's not as modular as we like, but it's due to BigQuery limitations more than dbt ones.

For anyone visiting in the future, here is a contrived example that implements  `pi()` and `radian()` methods, and tucks them under a `f_math` dataset. 

Note that `pi()` simply returns a constant, but `radian()` method *uses* the `pi()` method. This has consequences on how you must call the `pi()` method inside of `radian()` (it must be project id qualified)

In our `dbt_project.yml` we have three `on-run-start` methods. One creates the schema (dataset in BigQuery) if it doesn't exist, the other two create the Persistant UDFs.

```
on-run-start:

  # MATH FUNCTIONS (order must be preserved!!)
  - '{{ create_schema(""f_math"") }}'
  - '{{ make_func_math_pi() }}'
  - '{{ make_func_math_radian() }}'
```

The `create_schema` macro is a simple wrapper around `adapter.create_schema` that has `target.project` hard-coded into the first argument. We could have just-as easily called `adapter.create_schema` directly from the `on-run-start` hook.

```
-- macros/create_schema.sql

{% macro create_schema (schema_name) %}

{% do adapter.create_schema(target.project, schema_name) %}

{% endmacro %}
```

Our `pi()` UDF looks like this:

```
-- macros/udfs/math/pi.sql

{% macro make_func_math_pi () %}

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION f_math.pi() RETURNS FLOAT64 AS (3.141592653589793);

{% endmacro %}
```

and our `radian()` UDF:

```
-- macros/udfs/math/radian.sql

{% macro make_func_math_radian () %}

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION f_math.radian() RETURNS FLOAT64 AS (`{{ target.project }}`.f_math.pi() / 180);

{% endmacro %}
```

**Note** the need to use \``{{ target.project }}`\` inside of the `radian()` UDF definition. Without this, the UDF creation will fail on `dbt run` because BigQuery requires that functions be fully-qualified up to the project id.

While this example works, things get hairy when these libraries grow. As such, we've reached out to the UDF PM to ask if the multiple CREATE Persistent limitations could be lifted.",10
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","in step 2, if the udf code does a create library in addition to the create function, then this might cause an issue, 
as create library statement in redshift seems not valid to run inside a transaction, I got this error when I tried `CREATE LIBRARY cannot run inside a transaction block`",11
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","Hmm, I haven't tried this, but it's possible that if you run a `commit;` just before your `create library` statement, you'll get it to work! Let me know how that goes!",12
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","Hey @dabit -- I got some more info internally on this, and my previous reply is not a good one! Running a `commit;` isn't a great idea because it might mess with other queries that dbt runs, where dbt is expecting a transaction to already be open.


Instead, you could run this statement as an `operation` ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-operations)). So, before you `dbt run`, execute the following:
```
dbt run-operation create_udfs
```
You'll have to adjust your `create_udfs` macro to actually run each query -- the  `run_query`  macro will not begin a transaction automatically.
```
{% macro create_udfs() %}

{% do run_query('create or replace library my_library language plpythonu') %}

{% do run_query('create schema if not exists {{ target.schema }}') %};

{% do run_query(create_f_list_custom_keys()) %};

{% do run_query(create_f_count_custom_keys()) %};

{% do run_query(create_f_future_date() %}

^ I haven't tested this code but it should be close to the thing that you want!",13
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","thanks @claire, I just moved from a pre hook to a run-operation and it's working :+1: 
kept my create_udfs macro as is (similar to the one from your initial post minus the create library statements) i.e without wrapping them in run_query",14
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","Hi @claire - One question I have about this is the schema.  If one has overridden the default (built-in) `macros/get_custom_schema.sql` with their own logic, how would they make that a run-operation like that above comport with the custom schema logic being used during regular model compilation?",15
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","Here's one way to do it that worked for me:

1. Define the functions in a macro, and inside the macro call `set_sql_header` like this:
```
{% macro define_bigquery_functions() %}
{% call set_sql_header(config) %}
create temporary function int(value any type)
returns int64 as (
  cast(cast(value as decimal) as int64)
);
{% endcall %}
{% endmacro %}
```

2. Define a shorthand macro that wraps `config` like this:

```
{% macro table() %}
{{ define_bigquery_functions() }}
{{ config(materialized='table', **kwargs) }}
{% endmacro %}
```

3. Now you can just invoke `table()` instead of `config(materialized='table')` at the top of your model files, and you'll have access to your temporary functions!

Advantages of this method:
  - You don't have to specify the schema name in front of every function call
  - You don't have to wait for an extra `on-run-start` operation to run before every `dbt run`
  - Actually reduces boilerplate instead of adding more of it
  - You'll never again wonder whether `config()` takes `materialize=` or `materialized=`

Disadvantages of this method:
  - You can't call these functions inside view definitions (BigQuery doesn't support temporary functions in views)",17
18,"using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions","Hey, something that's taken me a while to figure out and probably worth adding to your post: we were getting errors in our build pipeline because we added a model and then referenced it in a UDF in the same pull request, which then triggered a build starting with `dbt seed`. When the `on-run-end` hook ran, it failed because it was referencing models that didn't exist.

I managed to resolve this by using the `WHICH` flag ([new in dbt 1.0](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/pull/4004)) as follows:

```sql
{% macro create_udfs() %}
  {% if flags.WHICH == ""run"" %}
    {{ create_unbilled_volume_report() }}
  {% else %}
    select 1 as id

...or something similar. Generally, what we recommend is for all models to include a unique key in the contents of the model itself. This helps with uniqueness testing so that you can avoid fanout errors in your SQL. If there is no natural key in the underlying data and you need to create a surrogate key, I'd recommend using the [surrogate key macro](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils/blob/master/macros/sql/surrogate_key.sql) in dbt-utils to create one.

29,"pii-anonymization-and-dbt","Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a real business concern with Data Warehouses. GDPR has more people talking about it now, but even without the new legislation it is something that needs careful consideration. 
Having a well structured Data Warehouse with exposed PII makes walking out the door with your entire customer email list as simple as ""SELECT * FROM customers""... and that's scary. 

Problem is, there are legit times you will need PII access. If an analyst is doing a study that needs components of the PII (like email provider), then a hashed string won't be very helpful. If you want to do 'fuzzy matching' when creating unified customer profiles, you need to start with raw PII. 

Here's how we tackle it at RevZilla:

1. Transform common PII values (first name, last name, email address) in an ephemeral model using a standardized macro. Simple transforms like trimming and down-casing allow us to compare apples to apples.

2. Materialize a hash salt under a _PRIVATE_schema, something like this:
        -- DB specific ways of random gen, I just did this as a semi-universal example.
        -- ideally you would do ascii lookups on the integers the rand returns. 
        SELECT RANDOM()::text AS salt LIMIT 1  

3. We materialize our production tables in a _PRIVATE_ schema, with the prefix PRIVATE on the table. I.e *ANALYSIS.PRIVATE.PRIVATE_USERS*. This schema is restricted and only our PII_GRANTED role can access it. 

4. We create a view of the table in the appropriate _business_ schema. The view should be sans prefix, I.e. *ANALYSIS.MARKETING.USERS*. This view includes a join to our SALT table. Then it is as a simple macro for each PII field that hashes the value with the salt:
    {%- macro anaon(col, salt) -%}
        MD5({{col}}, {{salt}})
    {%- endmacro -%}

And now the users have a safe, hashed value that they can aggregate on (because the hashes will match if the underlying values match).",1
29,"pii-anonymization-and-dbt","I love this. I think Snowflake makes a lot of this kind of stuff a bit easier than other warehouses--I find its permission model a bit easier to understand and we always end up implementing things in a much more locked-down way on Snowflake vs. Redshift.

Did you end up doing that right out of the gate or was it an enhancement you made to your warehouse along the way?",2
29,"pii-anonymization-and-dbt","This was definitely an iterative process. Initially we did what I'm sure a lot of shops do, and went very heavy-handed. There was to be **no** PII anywhere, ever, under any circumstances. Everything was obfuscated the second it hit the warehouse, no exceptions. What we found, of course, is that there are always use case exceptions; when business users had legit requirements for reporting that included PII we would send them back to the transactional system, totally undermining the point of BI. 
This 2 layer approach has worked really well so far. I've had to get creative as we move to marts - appending _private to mart schemas and creating the same 2 layers in a smaller context.",3

I’m trying to understand whether Snowflake prefers this format or Stitch is doing something odd.  What are others here doing syntax wise with Snowflake?

33,"table-field-syntax-best-practices-when-using-snowflake","Good q. We've found Snowflake's behavior related to capitalization to be rather...cumbersome!...and have recently made some changes to dbt to deal with it more effectively.

Snowflake will by default _uppercase_ identifier names which are unquoted. This is different than most databases which _lowercase_ identifier names which are unquoted. Our 0.10.1 release makes it possible to control whether or not dbt quoted your identifier names. 

Docs:
- https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/identifiers-syntax.html#identifier-syntax
- https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-quoting

After 0.10.1, I personally prefer to lower-case all of my Snowflake identifiers and configure dbt to _not_ quote them. I find this to be more readable, as dbt model names can be lower-cased, and SQL that references these models can also be lower-cased.",2
33,"table-field-syntax-best-practices-when-using-snowflake","A related note - in talking with the folks at Stitch, they decided not to quote the tables/fields when loading into Snowflake, since that would require people to have to quote within Snowflake on the query side.

43,"using-macros-to-handle-concatenation-of-possibly-null-fields","Note: The DB in use here is BigQuery

I did a dumb thing 10 months ago.  I was converting a python ETL script into SQL, and one of the steps builds a nested address record.  Into this nested record goes the address from the doctor record, and related records from the address table, where the address in the address table does _not_ match the address in the doctor table.

I handled this with a `doctor_addresses` model file which filters the `doctor`+`address` dataset to only those where at least one of the address component fields didn't match the corresponding field on the `doctor` record.  Here's what I did:
```sql
select
  d.dr_id
  ,d.address
  ,d.address2
  ,d.city
  ,d.state
  ,d.zipcode
  ,d.country
  ,d.latitude
  ,d.longitude
from {{ref('doctor')}} d
union distinct
select
  d.dr_id
  ,a.line1 as address
  ,a.line2 as address2
  ,a.city
  ,a.state_region as state
  ,a.postal_code as zipcode
  ,a.country_code as country
  ,a.latitude
  ,a.longitude
from {{ref('doctor')}} d
inner join {{ref('address')}} a
  on  d.dr_id = a.dr_id
where concat(d.address, d.address2, d.city, d.state, d.zipcode, d.country, d.latitude, d.longitude)
  != concat(d.line1, d.line2, d.city, d.state_region, d.postal_code, d.country_code, d.latitude, d.longitude)
```

The dumb thing was not accounting for the possibility that one of more of the address component fields might be `null`, and when that happens, the `concat()` function returns `null`.  And of course doing a `!=` between `null` and anything (including `null`) returns `null`.  So when any of the considered columns in either table was `null`, the second query of the union did nothing.

How _embarrassing..._

To resolve this, I need to cast the values as strings, then replace `null`s with empty strings, then concatenate.  That where clause would look like this:
```sql
select ...
where concat(
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.address as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.address2 as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.city as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.state as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.zipcode as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.country as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.latitude as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.longitude as string), '')
  ) != concat(
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.line1 as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.line2 as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.city as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.state_region as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.postal_code as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.country_code as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.latitude as string), ''),
  ifnull(safe_cast(d.longitude as string), '')
  )
```

Yuck.  It's ugly to look at, and there are lots of opportunities for misplaced commas, quotes, and parens.

The `group_by()` macro in the [dbt macro documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/macros), however, gave me the idea to build those `concat()`s dynamically.  It iterates through a list of passed field names, generating the `concat()` statement on the fly.
```
{% macro safe_concat(field_list) %}
  {# Takes an input list and generates a concat() statement with each argument in the list safe_casted to a string and wrapped in an ifnull() #}
  concat({% for f in field_list %}
    ifnull(safe_cast({{ f }} as string), '')
    {% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}
  {% endfor %})
{% endmacro %}
```

By using the macro, the `where` clause becomes quite approachable again:
```sql
select ...
where {{ safe_concat(['d.address','d.address2','d.city','d.state','d.zipcode','d.country','d.latitude','d.longitude']) }}
  != {{ safe_concat(['a.line1','a.line2','a.city','a.state_region','a.postal_code','a.country_code','a.latitude','a.longitude']) }}
```

50,"how-to-balance-the-need-for-controlled-development-of-core-models-with-rapid-development-of-peripheral-models","I'm struggling to have two different development ideologies coexist within dbt.  On the one hand is my team (BI) who is responsible for developing the core data model for the business.  Because those core components have broad impact across the business, development of those components needs to be pretty regimented.

On the other hand, there is a broad periphery of data models that need to be built and maintained by the business analyst group - they're assigned to specific business units, and given the pace of development in the business overall, they will need/want to iterate more quickly, and are more tolerant of flaws in their models.

So how should we structure dbt models to facilitate both ideals?  One thought I had was to have multiple repos (one for the core, and one or more for the data marts the BAs will create).  But it's not clear to me how execution would work in that sort of structure; would I include the data mart package(s) in the core package and `dbt run` from the core project?

It would seem, therefore that the data mart models should refer to the actual database objects generated by my team's dbt repo (rather than `{{ref()}}`, and the data mart package(s) should be independently executed, but this seems antithetical to ""the dbt way"" of doing things.",2

When I develop open source packages, I build the ""library"" (the thing I want to share with other people) and then a ""testing project"" (the thing I actually run the code from). This is necessary because in the library, I actually can't specify things like `profile` and many variable names, because those things need to be configured by the core project that is including the library. So--I build the shared code in the library, and then write the specific code that allows me to test and run that code (profiles, variable names, etc) in the ""testing project"" and _run everything from there_. I never actually push the testing project to any git repos...it's just for testing. But I come away with code in a library that I can run pretty seamlessly. 

This translates to your situation pretty directly, even if it sounds a bit roundabout. Your analysts would be able to clone your ""core"" project but not push to it. They would have editor permissions on your ""marts"" project. They would edit the code in `marts`, which would get pulled in as a dependency in `core`, and they'd always run from `core` (which isn't a problem; they can get the code just not edit it). 

Again...I recognize that this seems roundabout but it does work quite nicely in practice. Please let me know if there's some part of this that I can make more clear.",3

54,"looker-user-attributes-and-if-dev-to-auto-switch-between-dev-prod-schemas","At RealSelf, people developing in DBT default to having their models built in user-specific sandbox schemas. My sandbox schemas are `dbt_md_base` for raw or lightly cleansed data, `dbt_md_work` for interstitial models, and `dbt_md` for final modeled tables.  These mirror the production `dbt_base`, `dbt_work`, and `dbt` schemas.

We use Looker for visualization, and one of the challenges we face is how to switch between sandbox schemas and production schemas so we can test views and explores before rolling them out.  If we hard-code the table reference to the sandbox schema during development, at some point, someone will forget to change it to the production schema before release.

@Tristan talks about a solution to that in some detail [here](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/how-to-integrate-dbt-and-looker-with-user-attributes-117fa48c1568).  I'm here to offer an improvement to his solution.  **Do** use user attributes as he suggests, but what if there was a way to set the user attributes once, and then never touch them again, but have Looker automatically switch between sandbox and production based on whether or not you're in dev mode?

Rejoice, fellow Lookers, for there is indeed such a way!

Looker has a not-well-advertised feature that allows you to dynamically insert text into the `sql:` option of a derived table definition, based on whether the user is in dev mode or not.

```text
-- if dev -- some text
-- if prod -- some other text
```

Conveniently, Liquid is parsed after this feature, so we can combine this with user attributes like so:
```text
derived_table: {
    sql:
      SELECT
        some_field
        ,some_other_field
      FROM
        -- if dev -- {{_user_attributes['sandbox_schema']}}.some_table
        -- if prod -- {{_user_attributes['dbt_schema']}}.some_table
      ;;
  }
```

In dev mode, therefore, a view using both of these columns would generate this SQL:
```sql
WITH some_view AS (SELECT
        some_field
        ,some_other_field
      FROM
         dbt_md.some_table
        -- if prod -- dbt.some_table
      )
SELECT 
	some_view.some_field  AS some_view_some_field
    ,some_view.some_other_field  AS some_view_some_other_field
FROM some_view
```

And outside dev mode, it would generate this:
```sql
WITH some_view AS (SELECT
        some_field
        some_other_field
      FROM
        -- if dev -- dbt_md.some_table
        dbt.some_table
      )
SELECT 
	some_view.some_field  AS some_view_some_field
    ,some_view.some_other_field  AS some_view_some_other_field
FROM some_view
```

But for Looker explore that joins a couple of views, the 'conditional' statement don't seem to carry over. For example:

>   sql_table_name:

the JOIN ON statement only applies to prd.some_view.

To take a real-world example, I'm using Mode as a BI tool and I want to create a stacked bar chart showing how many recent upgrades there were by day for a certain segment of the users broken down by plan.

Here's what the query looks like if I write it directly in Mode:

```
select
  upgrade_date,
  plans.name as plan_name,
  count(*) as upgrades
from analytics.users 
join analytics.plans using (plan_id)
where
  upgrade_date >= current_date - interval '30 days' and
  vertical = 'work'
group by 1, 2
```

Alternatively, I can model this using dbt, something like this:

```
with recent_work_users as (

	select *
	from {{ ref('users') }}
	where
		vertical = 'work' and
		upgrade_date >= current_date - interval '30 days'

),

final as (

	select
	  upgrade_date,
	  plans.name as plan_name,
	  count(*) as upgrades
	from recent_work_users
	join analytics.plans using (plan_id)
	group by 1, 2

)

select * from final
```

And then in Mode simply run:

```
select * from analytics.recent_work_upgrades_by_plan
```

Which approach makes more sense - writing the query directly in Mode or modeling it in dbt? I could be wrong, but I feel like this isn't what I should be modeling in dbt, but writing the full query in Mode doesn't seem ideal either because it won't be version controlled, etc.

It may be that [analyses](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/analyses) are the way to go, but I'm unclear about how to fit them into my workflow. For example, I typically will draft a query, run it, then repeat a few times until things are just right. Would I do that in Mode, then paste the final query into a new analysis file, replacing the view names with dbt references & converting it to use CTEs, compile it, then paste the compiled query back into Mode? I'm guessing there's a better way :).

It seems like there are a lot of ways this can be done - which approach would you all recommend?",1
61,"writing-queries-in-a-bi-tool-vs-modeling-them-in-dbt","The key here is _interactivity_. dbt is not interactive--it's a batch-based tool, so all decisions are made at coding-time, not analysis-time. It's very common that a user might want to change the `interval '30 days'` in your query above (if that's not relevant in your particular use case just imagine one of the many use cases where such a thing might be configurable). If you build this as a model in dbt, you prevent the user from interactively looking at the data.

The way we use dbt is to ""provide the best version of all nouns"" to the BI layer. If you have an object called `plans`, dbt's job is to provide the BI layer with the cleanest possible definition of a plan. That way, you can keep your queries in the BI layer clean and focused on actual analysis, not data munging!",2
61,"writing-queries-in-a-bi-tool-vs-modeling-them-in-dbt","Thank you for this.

My challenge with Mode (vs a tool like Looker) is that it's not very interactive. For example, I could be wrong, but I don't think there's a way to use the UI to say ""show me the last 30 days"". You can select a [range of dates](http://c.hlp.sc/1I171l3z2Q0A), but not an duration of time relative to today. So If I want a chart showing upgrades over the last 30 days or for just this month or whatever, it has to be in a query. And because there's no modeling layer, all of the joins and whatnot have to happen in a query as well.

It sounds like you would recommend just throwing my original query above in Mode and not having it in dbt or version control at all, correct?

Can you elaborate on how you use dbt analyses in your work? For example, if it doesn't make sense to use analyses for something like this, how else are dbt analyses used in practice?",3

The answer to your short question of ""should I just put all of this stuff in Mode"" is, IMO, ""yes"" :) 

We don't actively make use of the ""analysis"" folder in dbt in any meaningful way. At some point we'd love to more directly integrate dbt's compilation of jinja with other tools (like Mode) but we're not there. This feature is a bit of a stub at the moment...use at your own risk.",4

62,"choosing-a-data-warehouse","I've been reading up on the differences between BigQuery and Redshift. I'm curious how you all would decide which is appropriate for an organization that's just getting set up with a data warehouse. Also, when would Snowflake be appropriate?",1
62,"choosing-a-data-warehouse","There are a few key factors:
### 1. Where is your existing infrastructure?
If your business has everything in AWS, it can simplify your life to just use Redshift.  If you're planning to go the full Google Analytics 360, you might prefer BigQuery for its native data flow from GA to BQ.

### 2. How much do you like managing infrastructure/how much infrastructure flexibility do you want?
BigQuery abstracts out all hardware considerations.  Just load the data and go.  But the Google Cloud ecosystem isn't as robust as AWS, so there isn't as much flexibility with respect to using the platform to move the pieces around versus having to write scripts to do that.  With Redshift, it's relatively seamless to move data from Redshift to EMR, or to use Kinesis to stream data into your DB, but then you have to manage the cluster yourself.

### 3. How much data?
If you don't have a ton of data, a pay-as-you-query setup like BigQuery might save you money (but might cost you more money longer term if and as your data volume grows), whereas there is a bit of a cost floor for Redshift.

---
I'm not a fan of the variable cost model of BigQuery, but I don't want to spend time managing infrastructure, and my company's got the full GA360 package, so BigQuery makes the most sense for us.

Regarding snowflake, I don't think there's a time where it's ""too early"" to consider it.  If you're at a volume now where Postgres doesn't cut it as a data warehouse, and you're going to go to an MPP system like Redshift or BigQuery, then you should be considering Snowflake _now_.  I implore you to decide which system you want 5 years from now and go with that now.  Migration can be painful, and should be avoided whenever possible by choosing wisely up front.

Good luck!",2
62,"choosing-a-data-warehouse","Thank you for the thoughtful response @michael.dunn - very helpful.",3
62,"choosing-a-data-warehouse","At Fishtown Analytics, we've worked with Postgres, Redshift, Snowflake, and BigQuery. Ultimately, each database has its own strengths and weaknesses.

@michael.dunn makes a great point above regarding your existing infrastructure. If you're on GCP, BigQuery probably makes a lot of sense. The same goes for AWS/Redshift. I don't think this is a hard-and-fast rule though, as Snowflake isn't offered by a particular cloud provider, and most off-the-shelf ETL services can pipe data across clouds.

My main insight here is that these databases are more similar than they are different, and all (except Postgres) are acceptable choices for a first data warehouse. I think some choices are better than others, but ultimately, there's a good reason for using each of them. The primary differences between these databases occur at an architectural level, and a summary of each of these is given below:

### Postgres
Postgres is a relational database, meaning that it stores _rows_ of data. It is fantastic for transactional application workloads, like selecting a single record from a `users` table, or updating the status of a couple of `orders`. 

Analytical queries tend to look very different than these ""transactional"" queries. Instead, you might do a `count(distinct)` on a whole column of data with no filters applied, or join four tables together and group by half a dozen fields, aggregating the rest. Postgres is not designed to handle queries like this, and you'll probably find that queries take forever to return unless indexes are liberally added to the columns that you join on.

To Postgres's credit, it will serve you well for analytical queries until your tables contain millions of records. My thinking here is generally that your data _will_ grow in volume. You can either migrate to a more capable analytical warehouse early (when it's not strictly necessary yet), and provide yourself a whole lot of runway. Or, you can wait until your data (and team!) outgrows Postgres, and you are _forced_ to migrate. I personally would prefer to be in the former situation, as migrating warehouses is very possible, but can be very not fun.

### Redshift
Amazon Redshift is a [columnar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS) database that is based on Postgres. Postgres and Redshift feel pretty similar - they both use the same protocol, and share (mostly) identical syntaxes.

Redshift stores data in columns (not rows), meaning that a given query will only read the columns required for its execution. This means that operations like [full table scans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_table_scan) are not only doable, but totally reasonable. You would probably have a bad time doing a full table scan on a large Postgres table.

A Redshift database is a _cluster_ of worker database nodes. These nodes are able to split up a query, execute its constituent parts in parallel, then combine the results. As a result, you can horizontally scale performance by adding nodes to your cluster. If you check out the [Redshift pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/) you'll see that adding a node will give you more processing power, as well as more storage.

This is sort of a problem though: sometimes you need a lot of storage space, but you don't need the extra processing power. The converse may also be true. This coupling of ""storage"" and ""compute"" is one of the main drawbacks of Redshift compared to the other databases listed below. As data teams push the limits of Redshift, they find themselves ""resizing"" their cluster to add another node every couple of months. This can be a painful and expensive process, and it gets pretty old pretty quickly.

Redshift comes with a bunch of configuration to optimize query performance like [sort keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_best-practices-sort-key.html) and [dist keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_best-practices-best-dist-key.html). You can also configure [compression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Compressing_data_on_disk.html) for your columns, or perform table maintenance tasks like [vacuum](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_VACUUM_command.html) and [analyze](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_ANALYZE.html). It ends up being close to a full-time job to keep Redshift humming along, and honestly, I think that time could be better spent _actually_ doing analytics. The databases below don't have as many bells and whistles, but you end up not really missing them. Maintaining Redshift can be a real chore.

Redshift is pretty easy to set up and is integrated deeply into the AWS ecosystem. You can natively pipe in data from S3, Kinesis, GLUE, etc. If using these tools is high on your priority list, then Redshift might be a good choice for your organization.

### BigQuery
BigQuery is Google's take on a distributed analytical database. Whereas in Redshift you might have six or eight compute nodes, BigQuery will throws _hundreds or thousands_ of nodes at you query. Further, storage on BigQuery is effectively infinite, and you just pay for how much data you load into and query in the warehouse. This means that truly insane amounts of data can be queried with pretty astounding query latency. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UueWySREWvk) is the best resource I've found on BigQuery under the hood; definitely give it a quick look if you're interested in using BQ.

So, BigQuery can process really big datasets really quickly, but it of course comes with some caveats. BigQuery is really, very bad at doing joins. The recommended way to to handle one-to-many relationships is through [repeated records](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated). Repeated records are a radically new data storage pattern that Google just decided to make up. These repeated records are incredibly useful and they work very well, but you'll need to internalize this feature of BigQuery to make effective use of its power.

I have a pretty good intuition for SQL and how databases work, but really, it just doesn't translate to BigQuery. I think that BQ is a great choice for a database, as long as the folks in your organization are willing to rewire their brains to take advantage of its features and access patterns.

BigQuery has some annoying artificial limitations. [Date partitioning](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables) is crucial for performant querying, but only something like 2,300 date partitions can be created at a given time. My bet is that limitations like these will become more flexible (or disappear) over time, but keep in mind that GMail was in Beta for five years, and Google's gonna do Google things.


### Snowflake
Snowflake is situated as a sort of happy medium between Redshift and BigQuery. It generally looks and acts how you would expect a database to behave. If you have existing intuition around analytics, it will probably translate to Snowflake pretty readily. Check out [this article](https://medium.com/@jthandy/how-compatible-are-redshift-and-snowflakes-sql-syntaxes-c2103a43ae84) for more information on migrating from Redshift to Snowflake.

Snowflake is more similar in architecture to Redshift than BigQuery. Crucially though, its storage is decoupled from its compute. With Snowflake you pay for 1) storage space used and 2) amount of time spent querying data. Snowflake also has a notion of a ""logical warehouse"" which is the ""compute"" aspect of the database. These warehouses can be scaled up or down to deliver different grades of performance. You can also configure the number of compute nodes to parallelize query execution. These warehouses can be configured to ""pause"" when you're not using them. As a result, you can have a super beefy warehouse for BI queries that's only running when people are using your BI tools, while your background batch jobs can use cheaper hardware.

Snowflake doesn't have all the performance optimization bells and whistles of Redshift, but you end up not really needing or missing them. Snowflake's query optimizer is substantially better than Redshift's, and I find myself not really thinking about performance considerations when writing SQL for Snowflake.

### Final thoughts
I prefer using Snowflake and BigQuery over Redshift because I can mostly just write the logic I want to implement without regard for how the database will execute the query behind the scenes. On Redshift, you have to think about column compression, sort keys, dist keys, disk utilization, or vacuum/analyze statements. `ERROR: Disk Full` is a thing you have to deal with on Redshift, but that's just not a class of error that can occur on BigQuery or Snowflake.

It is absolutely possible to migrate warehouses, but it can definitely be a big pain. The best advice I can give is: conduct analytics in a way that preserves your optionality. Avoid writing custom scripts to pipe data into Redshift; instead, use a tool like [Singer](https://singer.io/) that will pipe data to any of the warehouses listed above. Be judicious when using non-standard features of a warehouse (like Postgres GIS plugins, or BigQuery javascript UDFs). To be sure, you _should_ use your warehouse to its fullest potential, but definitely be mindful of how these decisions impact your switching cost. Today, Redshift feels old and crufty, but it was the best-in-class analytical warehouse only 6 years ago. This industry moves fast!

The good news is that technology in the data space [is becoming more modular](https://blog.modeanalytics.com/designing-analytics-stacks-like-software/), and databases are continuing to coalesce around a standard-ish version of SQL. If you're just getting started with a warehouse, really any of Redshift, Snowflake, or BigQuery are likely appropriate. I think that choosing Snowflake or BigQuery is probably a more forward-thinking decision, and they're my preference absent any other business-specific considerations.

This is just one analyst's opinion though. Here's some further reading:

Is it fair to say that this mainly applies at some level of scale where performance issues come into play? For example, when I write one-to-many queries in BigQuery, I write them without giving any thought to performance and have never noticed any significant issues. For a simple example, this query takes about 4 seconds:

```
select com_id, count(tag_id) as tags
from mysql_app.app_companies 
left join mysql_app.app_companies_tags on tag_com_id = com_id
group by 1
```

81,"using-window-functions-in-incremental-tables","**TL;DR**: Should I just create views on top of incremental tables? My gut says probably.

We have a number of incremental tables that we refer to as 'daily timeseries' tables. They reflect the state of a record at the end of each day. 

dbt is great for these materialising these tables, except in a few use-cases where we need to use window functions that evaluate the whole table. Because we only load yesterday and today's data in each incremental load, the window functions would only evaluate the values for those two days instead of the whole table.

We have started building views on top of the incremental models to calculate the window functions, which is working okay, but I wanted to see if there was a preferable way of dealing with this that others have found? I don't really have an issue with the view method, except that it appears to make some queries against the final output a bit slower, even when the window function isn't being used. (For the most part, we get around this issue by dynamically changing which model is queried in Looker using the `in_query` liquid variable in LookML.)

Has anyone else found other ways of dealing with this? Thanks!",1
81,"using-window-functions-in-incremental-tables","Heh. You're diving into the deep end here. 

Incremental models in dbt are *wonderful* and many times they just work, and make incremental builds very straightforward. There are two specific cases when they don't work great, though: `distinct` and window functions. Both of these require more context than just recent data to appropriately calculate their values.

There are two different ways to deal with this, and each of them take a bit more work than what would typically be involved in building a dbt model:

1. **Incremental model >> view or table.**
Put the stuff that can be incrementalized into an incremental model and then layer another model on top of it for distincts or window functions. Sounds like this is what you're doing today. I'd recommend putting a table on top of it instead of a view so that you can limit the complexity of downstream queries...the extra storage is cheap and the strategy you outline just adds complexity.
2. **Write custom logic to combine results**
It's also possible to query the existing table and get the current value of, for example, a row number. Then, you can add that row number value to the incremental data to get the true value for incremental rows. This strategy allows you to incremental-ize the whole transformation, but can require meaningfully more code. When you're transforming datasets of many terabytes, this type of strategy is very important because strategy #1 just isn't really feasible. Use specific database features like sort key or date partitioning to get the current values without performing full table scans.

It's possible to go deep down a rabbit hole with #2, creating intermediate tables storing all kinds of bookmark values that essentially just allow your incremental jobs to work. It's all about a performance / code complexity tradeoff though. It sounds like your current approach is working out ok.",2
81,"using-window-functions-in-incremental-tables",":+1: Thanks @tristan. That makes sense. Do you have any publicly available examples of #2? We will definitely stick with #1 for the moment, and take your suggestion about materialisation, but want to understand what that next step looks like.",3
81,"using-window-functions-in-incremental-tables","I actually don't think we do. The only times we've had to do that are on very specific client applications, and that code doesn't lend itself well to being open sourced. Sorry about that!",4
81,"using-window-functions-in-incremental-tables","We did this by creating an `updated_key` column to use for the incremental `sql_where` value, which I think is what Tristan is saying in #2. In our case, we are just using `lead()` to grab information from the record immediately after the current row:

```sql
-- Check if there is another bid after this, if not, then this is the winning bid
lead(bids.bid_id, 1) OVER (partition by bids.item_id order by bids.bid_id) IS NULL AS is_winning_bid,
```

In this example, `is_winning_bid` is dependent on whether another bid exists after this one for the item. With an incremental model only built from `bid_id` or `updated_at`, this would fail to update if a new high bid is created after the table is built. So, we check for both bids in our `sql_where` key:

```sql
-- This field is used to let dbt know what records need to be updated since the model last ran. Usually,
-- we would just use an updated_at timestamp, but this model is also dependent on the bid placed after the current
-- bid, so we need to use the greatest of the bid_id from both bids.
greatest(bids.bid_id, lead(bids.bid_id, 1) OVER (partition by bids.item_id, bids.bidder_id order by bids.bid_id)) AS data_updated_key,
```
And then our incremental config:
```
{{
  config(
    materialized = 'incremental',
    sql_where = 'data_updated_key > (select max(data_updated_key) from {{ this }})',
    unique_key = 'bid_id'
  )
}}
```
So now our `data_updated_key` will be the newest of both bids in our window function. This is a simple example as we are only looking at one additional row using the `lead()` function. As Tristan mentioned, this could get considerably more complex if you have multiple different window function columns you need to consider for.",5

There's an ever-growing list of raw immutable events:

- `timestamp` - date and time of an event

- `id` - agent ID

- `is_online` - true if an agent got online, false if went offline

Milestone no.1 is to calculate the number of unique agent IDs that were online (even for a moment) on a given day, i.e.:

- `day` - date

- `num_online_ids` - number of unique agent IDs that were online (even for a moment)

Milestone no.2 is to do the same on a rolling 28-day basis:

- `day` - date

- `num_online_ids_28d` - number of unique agent IDs that were online in the previous 28 days

> Incremental models in dbt are *wonderful* and many times they just work, and make incremental builds very straightforward. There are two specific cases when they don’t work great, though: `distinct` and window functions. Both of these require more context than just recent data to appropriately calculate their values.

Sounds like it might be a tough nut to crack, because right away I can see `distinct` and window functions coming into play.

I was thinking maybe aggregate periods when agents were online into non-overlapping timestamp ranges:

- `id` - agent ID

- `start_ts` - date and time when an agent got online

- `end_ts` - date and time when an agent went offline

Then explode those into ID-day pairs leveraging something like [`dbt_utils.data_spine`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#date_spine-source):

- `id` - agent ID

- `day` - date when an agent was online

But I realize the SQL will be getting very hairy pretty quickly.

Have there been any new developments/considerations/breakthroughs in this area in the past couple of years @tristan ?

Being completely new to dbt, I'm afraid of missing something obvious or already implemented/packaged.

82,"do-you-test-ephemeral-models","We test all (probably really most) of our views and tables that sit in our analytics schema, which is all the data that is deemed to be ready for use.

We currently don't have much testing on downstream models that aren't materialised, particularly 'base' ephemeral models that have no joins and effectively just cleans up the individual raw tables. We've started doing it, which has massively increased the number of tests of project has (>1000), and I wanted to know what people's views on this are.

It's starting to take much longer for the tests to run as well. We currently run tests after each production refresh of the tables, which may not be necessary. 

Questions:

* Do you test all your ephemeral/down-stream models?
* Do people have a specific setup with all of this? 
* Is there a best practice?",1
82,"do-you-test-ephemeral-models","I like testing everything, including ephemerals. It's a handy development tool. It does take quite some time to run all tests though.",2
82,"do-you-test-ephemeral-models","Agreed, we like testing ephemeral models. Thinking behind this:

1. We create ephemeral models for other downstream models to use. 
2. The downstream models are invariably making a bunch of assumptions about the data coming out of the ephemeral models.
3. It can be hard or even impossible to reliably test all of the assumptions made by the ephemeral models indirectly in the downstream models. Worst-case scenario is that an assumption is violated, but all of the downstream models and tests function properly and incorrect data gets used in analytics and then incorrect decisions are made based on these incorrect analytics.
4. Therefore we should test as many assumptions as we can about ephemeral models in an automated fashion.

Yes, it does cause more tests to run which can cause a slowdown. One solution could be tagging or only running subsets of tests at various times.

Also, from a dbt perspective it seems like not such a great idea to being attached to models being ephemeral. The whole point is to easily be able to flip between model types - ephemeral, view, and table as performance or other needs dictate. If we design something with the hardcoded assumption that it will always and only be ephemeral we're probably building in some technical debt or bugs that will pop up in the future.",3

So, rather than extraction and loading, dbt exists to transform data once it's _already loaded_ into your warehouse. Using dbt, you can select data from your source schemas, then transform that data in SQL, writing the resulting data out into a different ""analytics"" schema. You can find a little bit more about this workflow in the [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/overview#section-how-does-dbt-work-).

You mentioned:
> can I create models where source and target are in dfferent database in redshift?

The answer is unfortunately ""no"" -- Redshift doesn't allow you to transfer data between different ""logical"" databases in a single warehouse. I'd recommend using schemas inside of a single ""logical"" database to separate your source data and your dbt models.

92,"running-dbt-in-kubernetes","Hey there! We've been working with `dbt` and using Sinter for quite a while now. We felt that we needed a bit more control and decided to give a try to running and scheduling `dbt` in one of our Kubernetes clusters. In this post I’d love to share how we did it.

## Running `dbt` on Kubernetes

The main objective is to replace Sinter scheduled runs with a custom environment based on Kubernetes Cronjobs. This gives some flexibility but it also takes some time to setup and maintain :wrench: .

### 1. Creating the Docker Image

Lets assume a `dbt` project with the [default folder structure](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-starter-project) is in place. Running that project with `dbt` using Docker is as simple as writing a similar Dockerfile to this one, then building(`docker build -t your-dbt-image-name:tag .`) and running it.

```Dockerfile
FROM davidgasquez/dbt:0.10.0

COPY your-dbt-folder /dbt

CMD [""dbt"", ""run"", ""--profiles-dir"", ""profile""]
```

The image in which is based is [dbt-docker](https://github.com/davidgasquez/dbt-docker). You can see a complete example in the [kubedbt](https://github.com/davidgasquez/kubedbt) repository. 

The `CMD` step is using a flag to specify the source of the [profiles file](https://github.com/davidgasquez/kubedbt/blob/master/project-test/profile/profiles.yml). This is really helpful when running inside Docker as you can pass the secrets through the environment! That meand that you’ll need to setup a few environment variables in a `.env` file. 

If everything is setup properly you should be able to run `docker run --env-file .env -it --rm your-dbt-image-name:tag` locally.

### 2. Setting up the Cronjob

Next step is telling Kubernetes to run that command periodically. To do that, simply create a new Cronjob resource YAML file (cronjob.yaml) pointing to the Docker Image you created and pushed to a registry. 
```
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: your-dbt-project
spec:
  schedule: ""0 16 * * *""
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: your-dbt-project
            image: username/your-dbt-image-name:tag
            env:
              - name: REDSHIFT_DB_NAME
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: redshift
                    key: database
              ...
              ...
            imagePullPolicy: Always
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

 If you don't have the secrets created in the cluster, you'll also need to create the proper resource.

Running `kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml` will create a Cronjob in Kuberetes. That cronjob will take care of running `dbt` once a day ([exactly at 16:00](http://www.adminschoice.com/crontab-quick-reference)).

There are a couple of interesting options to keep in mind:
- `restartPolicy`: This will make Kubernetes restart the job (that runs all the models) in case of unhandled errors. You can read more about `dbt` [exit codes in the official docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/v0.8/reference#exit-codes).
- `imagePullPolicy`: With this setting, Kubernetes will always pull the image from the container registry and ignore the cached one. This makes deploying as easy as pushing the Docker image to the registry!

### 3. Adding CI/CD

This step is optional but recommended unless you want to push the image manually each time. There are numerous CI/CD vendors so I'll skip the implementation details. These are the things it should take care after each change to the repository `master` branch.:

1. Build a new Docker image with the same name and tag
2. Upload the image to the registry (overwriting the existing one)
3. *(Optional)* Test the models
4. *(Optional)* Update the Cronjob resource in Kubernetes. This is helpful when changing the schedule or base image

With the previous setup, at any point in time, you’ll only have a Docker Image for each `dbt` project. Rolling back can be done just reverting the code changes that triggers the continuous integration pipeline.

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting

As with CI/CD, there are a vast number of vendors and each one might need a custom implementation. That said, there's one thing almost all of them will need. **Structured logging**.

Calling `dbt` from the command line prints out some custom messages. There are really handy for the human eye but not that useful for machines to parse. Luckily, `dbt` has an internal API we can use. Once we're able to write our own logs we'll hook to any monitoring or alerting vendor.

This is an example showing how a simple script (`run.py`) could look if you want to write custom logs using the internal `dbt` API:

```
import dbt
import dbt.main
import dbt.logger
import logging
import json

logger = logging.getLogger(""dbt"")
logger.setLevel(logging.FATAL)

logging.info(""DBT Run Started"")

results, success = dbt.main.handle_and_check([""run"", ""--profiles-dir"", ""profile""])

for res in results:
    name = res.node.get(""alias"")
    if res.errored:
        error = res.error
        logging.error(f""Model {name} errored! Error: {error}"")
    else:
        time = int(res.execution_time)
        logging.info(f""Model {name} completed in {time} seconds"")

logging.info(""DBT Run Completed!"")
```

After that, you’ll need to change the Dockerfile and execute `CMD [""python"", ""run.py""]` instead of just `dbt run`.

113,"faq-cleaning-up-removed-models-from-your-production-schema","If you remove a model from your dbt project, dbt does not automatically drop the relation (table/view) from your schema. This means that users can end up with extra objects in their production schema, which can reduce the reliability of your prod data.

As a result, we've seen a few questions about how to clean up these objects in your production schema on Slack.

**Option 1: Periodically drop and rebuild the entire schema.**
dbt is built on the assumption that everything can be rebuilt at any given time, so this is a really easy way to remove objects.
However, it's not for the faint of heart, and may cause some downtime

**Option 2: Query the information schema to find extra objects in prod.**
I have the following query in my `analysis` directory. When run against my database, it finds objects (tables, views, functions) that exist in a prod schema but does not exist in the related dev schema. 
Note that this works for me because I routinely drop my dev database so don't have any extra objects in it. This query has been tested against Redshift and Postgres.

```sql
-- set pairs of schemas up as a cte for maximum flexibility
with dbt_schemas as (
  select
  'analytics' as prod_schema,
  'analytics_claire' as dev_schema
  union all
  select
  'foo' as prod_schema,
  'foo_claire' as dev_schema
)

, objects as (
  select
  lower(coalesce(nullif(table_type, 'BASE TABLE'), 'table')) as obj_type,
  table_schema as obj_schema,
  table_name as obj_name
  from information_schema.tables

  union all

  select
  'function' as obj_type,
  specific_schema as obj_schema,
  routine_name as obj_name
  from information_schema.routines
  where routine_type = 'FUNCTION'
)
, prod_objects as (
  select
  objects.*
  , dbt_schemas.dev_schema as expected_dev_schema
  from objects
  inner join dbt_schemas on dbt_schemas.prod_schema = objects.obj_schema
)

, prod_only_objects as (
  select prod_objects.*
  from prod_objects
  left join objects on objects.obj_schema = prod_objects.expected_dev_schema
    and objects.obj_name = prod_objects.obj_name
    and objects.obj_type = prod_objects.obj_type
  where objects.obj_name is null
)
select
  '-- drop ' ||  obj_type || ' if exists ""' || obj_schema || '"".""' || obj_name || '"" cascade;' as drop_statement
from prod_only_objects

```
The query returns a set of sql statements that can then be copied to a sql console and executed to drop the extra objects.

Ideally I'd return the first part of the query as a dbt [statement](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference#statement) and output the drop statements themselves to a sql file in `compiled/analysis/`. However, analyses are built when you execute `dbt compile`, and dbt statements are only executed on `run` (rather than `compile`). As such, it's not possible to return the results of the dbt statement to your Jinja context.

**Option 3: ???**
There's probably also a third way to do this which would involve iterating through your dbt project to find the expected objects, and comparing it to the state of your prod schemas. Let me know if anyone investigates this option!",1
113,"faq-cleaning-up-removed-models-from-your-production-schema","A similar approach to option 2 is to query the information schema for objects that haven't been updated recently. We run dbt 3x a day so these queries returns objects that should be dropped (we use snowflake)

To use the macro run the following, substituting your schemas:

```bash
dbt run-operation delete_outdated_tables --args ""{schema: [foo, bar, baz]}""
```

**What does it do?**
Queries the information schema to find all tables and views (within the specified schemas), removes any from the list that exist in the current graph, and attempts to delete the rest.  Also handles seeds.

**Limitations**
Doesn't handle sources. Ephemeral models may prevent something from being deleted.  Currently only works for postgres (and maybe redshift).",3

113,"faq-cleaning-up-removed-models-from-your-production-schema","I just had to do a similar process, with a focus on dropping source tables that we had added to our sync job in the past but weren't using. 

I approached this with a combo of the [Jinja graph variable](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/graph#accessing-sources), the information_schema and the venerable spreadsheet. 

To build a list of sources we _did_ use, I used the compiled results of this snippet: 
```
{% for node in graph.sources.values() -%}
  select '{{ node.schema }}' as s_name, '{{ node.name }}' as t_name
  {%- if not loop.last %} union all {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

And pasted their results into this query: 

```
with defined_sources as (
    select 'users' as s_name, 'users' as t_name union all
    select 'users' as s_name, 'contactroles' as t_name union all
    ...
    select 'ft_hubspot' as s_name, 'ticket' as t_name
),
     
relevant_tables as (
    select 
        table_schema as s_name, 
        table_name as t_name
    from information_schema.tables
    where table_schema not ilike 'dev_%' --our dbt dev schemas
    and table_schema not ilike 'analytics%' --our output schemas
    and table_schema not in ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema', 'admin', 'public', 'census', 'inbound__timesheets_and_quality_control') --Redshift internal tables and tables built by using get_relations_by_pattern instead of being defined
)

select * from relevant_tables
except
select * from defined_sources
```

This gave me all the tables in the warehouse that weren't defined in dbt, so we weren't using and could consider dropping to save disk usage and reduce load on the source databases.

To focus on the biggest tables first, I wanted to combine it with the metadata from `SVV_TABLE_INFO`: 
```
select
   schema as s_name,
   ""table"" as t_name,
   size as size_mb,
   tbl_rows as total_rows
from SVV_TABLE_INFO
```

However, I found that [information_schema queries always run against the leader node](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57327730/14007029) which meant I couldn't join the results of this query with my first query. Instead, I dumped the results to a spreadsheet and worked it out there.",8

* Re-set the schema variable to always be a list to prevent duplicate logic checking the schema type repeatedly
* Always use uppercase schemas to match Snowflake consistently
* Join the Snowflake information_schema data to values for both the current dbt node's schema and the provided target schemas, to handle cases where a user is in a target environment whose schema differs from the desired schema
* Insert an exception to exit the script if a BRONZE schema is about to be dropped, to prevent dropping raw source data in an automated CI/CD job (assumption being that dropping calculated silver/gold views and tables is less risky, since we can always recreate them from the raw bronze data instead)

121,"publishing-dbt-docs-to-netlify","**What is DBT Docs?**
DBT Docs is the fantastic new feature which enables the autogeneration of documentation of your models and enables you to create descriptions of fields and tables among its many neat new features.
It is available from v0.11 and can be generated with the command `dbt docs generate`.

To serve these docs locally, you can run the command: `dbt docs serve`.

Now this is great when you want to view this documentation on your own machine, but that isn't very scalable when you're in a distributed company of any size. An alternative is to host it on an ec2 instance with nginx or apache but this would be overkill for a static webpage.

Enter Netlify, a largely free static site web hosting solution: 
https://www.netlify.com/

In order to deploy your documentation site, you'll need to
- create a netlify account
- run dbt docs generate from within your dbt folder
- drag the ""target"" folder from dbt into netlify where it says to ""drag and drop your site folder here""
- this will create a manual site and viola you are done!

If you would like to password protect this site (recommended if it contains sensitive information about your companies data warehouse schemas), you can get that on a teams based plan which is $9 per user per month - here's some docs on the feature:
https://www.netlify.com/docs/visitor-access-control/

**Advanced topic**
Integrating this into your CI/CD pipeline, you can auto-deploy after `dbt run` and `dbt docs generate` to Netlify using the following CLI tool:

122,"understanding-hash-joins-in-redshift-query-plan","Hey @dylanbaker  - this is a great question!

Hash joins can be used when there’s a join on an _equality_, eg:

```
select ...
from table_a
join table_b on table_a.id = table_b.id
```

it does _not_ work for _inequality_ joins like:

```
select ...
from table_a
join table_b on table_a.id > table_b.id
```

To understand why this is the case[1], you need to understand Hash Maps.

### Hash Maps
A [Hash Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) is a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) that supports constant-time lookups, meaning: computers can figure out if a _key_ is present in a Hash Map in a single operation! This is not true of all data structures, as we'll see below.


### Detour: Arrays
Another type of data structure is an Array. You can generally think of Arrays as ""lists"", but my computer science professors would be mad if I told you the two terms were interchangeable.

Arrays are indeed used to maintain an ordered collection of things. Computers can return the _element_ at a specific _index_ in an Array in a single step. Imagine you have an Array like this:

```
[""Apple"", ""Banana"", ""Pear"", ""Orange"", ""Grapefruit""]
```

Each _element_ in the Array has an _index_:

| index | element |
|-|-|
|0|Apple|
|1|Banana|
|2|Pear|
|3|Orange|
|4|Grapefruit|

Given this Array, a computer can tell you that the 3rd element in the Array (index=2) is `Pear` in a single operation. It's harder for computers to answer other types of questions with Arrays. A question like
> is there an element named `Falafel`  in there?

will require the computer to look at every single element in the Array. You may be able to look up the element at an index in a single operation, but finding an element by its value requires one operation for each element! That means that an Array with `N` items requires `N` operations to find an element, so we call searching Arrays for elements a  ""Linear"" operation. If the Array doubles in size, then it will require twice as many operations to find an element.

### Detour: Sorted Arrays

Bear with me here - I know this question is about Hash Maps! 

We just saw that finding an element in an Array is a ""linear"" operation, but this isn't always the case. Instead, imagine that we sorted our Array of fruit. Sorted alphabetically, it would look like:

| index | element |
|-|-|
|0|Apple|
|1|Banana|
|2|Grapefruit|
|3|Orange|
|4|Pear|

If you know that the values are sorted, then you can start in the middle of the Array and repeatedly bisect it until you find (or don’t find) the value you’re looking for. A search for ""Orange"" would look like:

1. Start in the middle
  --> index=2, element=Grapefruit

2. ""Orange"" comes after ""Grapefruit"" alphabetically, so we know that if Orange is in the Array, it's in the second half of the list.

3. Pick a new index between the current index (2) and the last index in the Array (4)
  --> index=3, element=Orange. Found it! 

In this example, we only needed to check two elements instead of four! This algorithm is called ""Binary Search"", and it's a great way to find elements in a sorted Array. Since you can cut the search space in half with each guess, the number of guesses you need grows “logarithmically” with the size of the Array. Therefore, doubling the size of the Array only requires one extra guess! We’d call this a `log n` search function, since the number of guesses you need to make is about `log_2(N)`, where N is the size of the Array. This is super handy if you have thousands or millions of items in an Array, and you need to find one in particular.

The big idea here is that by spending a little extra time sorting the list, we can vastly improve the performance of our search functions. So, onto Hash Maps....

### Hash Maps (for real this time)

Let's imagine that we again have a series of Fruit:

```
[""Apple"", ""Banana"", ""Pear"", ""Orange"", ""Grapefruit""]
```

Recall: Arrays can tell us the _element_ found at an _index_ in a single operation. Hash Maps are a way of exploiting this property of Arrays to find an element by it's _value_ in a single operation. To do this, we need to convert the _value_ of an element into its _index_. We can do that using a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function).

You might be familiar with hash functions like MD5, but that’s only one type of hash function. A different type of hash function might accept a string (like ""Apple"") and return an integer between 0 and 100. This function might work by assigning a number to each letter of the alphabet, then doing some clever math to produce a value for the input string.

A hash function will always produce the same value for a given input, so if Apple is hashed to 75 once, it will _always_ be hashed to 75 using the same algorithm.

With our hash function, we can produce numbers between 0 and 100 for different types of fruits. In the above example, that might look like:

| element | `hash(element)` |
|-|-|
|Apple|28|
|Banana|52|
|Grapefruit|81|
|Orange|7|
|Pear|12|

Next, we can create an Array with 100 elements, initialized to be totally empty. Further, we can place each element at the index indicated by the hash of it's value. That would look like:

| index | element |
|-|-|
|0|NULL|
|1|NULL|
|...|...|
|7|Orange|
|...|...|
|12|Pear|
|...|...|
|28|Apple|
|...|...|
|52|Banana|
|...|...|
|81|Grapefruit|
|...|...|
|98|NULL|
|99|NULL|

In the above example, the _index_ of each _element_ in the Array is determined by hashing it's _value_. Just as we saw in the Sorted Array example, building this Hash Map takes time, but it pays dividends! With this data structure, we can determine if elements are present in the Hash Map in a single operation[2]! To determine if an element is present in a Hash Map:
1. Calculate the hash of the element you want to find to produce an index
2. Get the element at that index

If the element is present, then :boom:, you found it! If there's nothing there, then you know the element isn't present in the Hash Map. A couple of quick examples:

1. Is Banana present?
  - hash(Banana) = 52
  - lookup(52) = Banana, present!

2. Is Falafel present?
  - hash(Falafel) = 40
  - lookup(40) = NULL, not present!

### But... databases?

Pulling this back to the database world: Building a Hash Map takes some time, but then you can do a _constant time lookup_ for every comparison in the join! I think databases typically hash the smaller of the two tables in a join, then they iterate through the bigger table, hashing each value and consulting the Hash Map to determine if the row should come through the join or not. This type of join becomes effectively ""linear"" in complexity with the size of the bigger table, which is pretty good!

If the database couldn't do a Hash Join, it would instead need to do a ""Nested Loop Join"". This would require the database to check every value in the left table against every value in the right table. The complexity of a Nested Loop Join would be ""quadratic"", in that you need to do about N*N (or N²) different operations to process the join. Not great! Nested Loop Joins don't hold up when you're joining million-row tables together -- your database might end up needing to complete trillions of operations to execute that join! Compare that to a logarithmic algorithm, where log_2(1000000) is close to 20 :slight_smile: 

So, this touches on some other topics that I won't dig into here, but that are definitely deserving of future posts:
1. We saw that sorted datasets support faster lookups, which should give you a sort of intuition for Sort Keys on Redshift, for instance.
2. Databases like Redshift use ""statistics"" to determine which of the tables in a join is ""smaller"". That's part of why it's so important to run `analyze` periodically!
3. In some cases, spending time pre-processing a dataset can pay dividends. While building a Hash Map is time consuming, a Hash Join will be faster than a Nested Loop Join for any moderately sized dataset.
4. There's no such thing as a free lunch! A Hash Map requires memory space, which you're trading in exchange for performance. It's hard to have it both ways, and generally optimizing for one will require sacrificing the other. Tradeoffs!


This ended up being more of a computer science flavored answer then a database-specific one, but I think it's super important to build intuition like this. There are heaps (:wink:) of other data structures and algorithms out there that Databases make use of, and a basic understanding of the science can really help you reason about things like database performance and optimizer decisions.

---

[1] I didn't really spend time explaining this, but inequality joins don't work with Hash Maps because you're not checking for item presence in a list, you're instead computing an expression. While we can hash a date like `2018-01-01`, we definitely can't hash an expression like `date >= 2018-01-01`. These queries will probably be executed using Nest Loop Joins.

[2] I said ""single operation"", but ""hash"" and ""find by index"" are two operations! When we talk about algorithm complexity, we frame it in regards to the size of the dataset. More precisely than ""a single operation"", you would say that the search occurs ""in constant time"". The amount of time/steps required to find an element in a Hash Map does not change with the size of the dataset!

123,"how-to-create-efficient-timeseries-models-or-how-to-join-efficiently-on-inequalities","Somewhat inspired by @drew's great answer to [this question](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/understanding-hash-joins-in-redshift-query-plan/122/5) about hash tables:

**What we currently do**

We need to report on the state of various records as of the end of every day, based on [Type 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension#Type_4:_add_history_table) history tables created by our Django application. For example, this could be the facility limits of each of our borrowers on a daily basis.

Currently, our models take the following steps:

1. Build a daily timeseries model. We build this as a utility table in our production schema as we use it in multiple places.

1. Join on to each day all records from the history table that occured prior to or on that date.

1. `row_number()` for each record/day combo to understand which is the most recent record to that day.

1. Filter on `row_number_field = 1`.

This typically looks like this:
```
with timeseries as (

    select * from {{ ref('timeseries') }}

), history as (

    select * from {{ ref('facility_history') }}

), joined as (

    select 
        t.date_day,
        h.*,
        row_number() over (partition by t.date_day, h.id order by h.action_date desc) 
              as row_number_field
    from timeseries t
    inner join history h
        on h.action_date <= t.date_day

)

select *
from joined
where row_number_field = 1
```
_where_ action_date _is the date of the change to the record_.

This works fine and we build all of these tables incrementally. However, the initial builds take forever and even some of the incremental loads are less efficient than I'd like because of the “Nested Loop Join”.

**My question**

Is there a more efficient way to do this without joining on the inequality? We have instances where the join criteria are similar but more complicated where this becomes more of an issue.

One solution that came to mind was leaving as is for the initial load (or exploring @claire's new split up incremental materialisation) but for each incremental load, which replaces the current day's value until the day is over, we simply insert the last value from the history table. Has anyone implemented anything like that?",1
123,"how-to-create-efficient-timeseries-models-or-how-to-join-efficiently-on-inequalities","@dylanbaker I don't know all of the context around this, but I think I would just write the query a little differently... 

```
with timeseries as (

    select * from {{ ref('timeseries') }}

), history as (

    select * from {{ ref('facility_history') }}

), history_agg as (

    select 
        h.*,
        h.action_date::date as date_day
        row_number() over (partition by h.id order by h.action_date desc) 
          as row_number_field
    from history

),

history_daily as (

    select * from history_agg where row_number_field = 1

),

joined as (

    select 
      t.date_day,
      h.* --modify to select everything but date_day here
    from timeseries t
    left join history_daily h 
      on t.date_day = h.date_day 
      

)

select * from joined
``` 

The core intuition here is that you want to aggregate prior to joining--you previously were joining and aggregating within the same step, which caused the database's intermediate result to be much bigger than you actually needed. Find the most current row for `history`, then left join it back to `timeseries` on a shared key. 

If what you actually need is to join a single daily record from `history_daily` to **multiple** records in `timeseries` because you don't always have a record for every day, then use a lag window function to create a `from_date` and `to_date` so that you can do **two inequalities instead of one**. There is no way to get away from the nested loop join in this condition but you want to limit the total # of rows returned. Currently the fact that you're only using a single inequality can cause a massive fanout. I think. I frequently need to write date inequality joins just like you're doing, and never do so without including both a greater than and a less than.",2

    h.action_date::date as date_day row_number() over (partition by h.id order by h.action_date desc)

from history
[/quote]

In `history_agg` above, are we trying to pull the last record of each day for each `id`? I think we also therefore need to partition by `h.action_date::date`? I may have misunderstood the change.

Otherwise, that all completely makes sense. We don't have records for every day in the history table so, as you suggested, I think a lead window function will work well. :+1:",3
123,"how-to-create-efficient-timeseries-models-or-how-to-join-efficiently-on-inequalities","@dylanbaker

I had a similar situation where I was trying to get the most recent value for a particular primary key. I normally use the approach you and @tristan describe but in this particular case, Redshift performed better by doing a self-join with the most recent record. It looks something like this:

```
with history as (

    select * from {{ ref('facility_history') }}

), history_id_x_max_date as (

    select
        id,
        max(action_date) as action_date
    from history
    group by 1

),

new_history as (

    select *,
           row_number() over (partition by id order by action_date desc)
              as row_number_field
    from history
    join history_id_x_max_date using (id, action_date)

),

history_daily as (

    select * from new_history where row_number_field = 1

)

....
```
I am not sure why but after adding this self-join the query performed better than using the row_number() function directly against the unfiltered table.

Of course, if your data only has one record per id/date, you would not need the row_number() in this case.

I'm curious to learn if my situation was unique or if this helps in other cases.",4

133,"faq-handling-timezone-conversion-and-timestamp-truncation-in-data-warehouses","A common question we see in the dbt community is around how people are handling timestamps in their data warehouse – more specifically:
* whether people store timestamps in UTC or in a timezone, or both, and
* whether people perform timestamp truncations in their warehouse

The orthodox, Kimball-style, advice on the subject is to store timestamps as both UTC and local, and store date and time as separate fields. However, when working in a modern data stack (as described [here](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/what-are-the-steps-tools-in-setting-up-a-modern-saas-based-bi-infrastructure-281e0860f9a9), and [here](https://medium.com/@foundinblank/whats-a-data-stack-7c96f7a15fe8)), that advice feels a bit outdated for a few reasons:
* Data warehouses have advanced so that you do not need to be concerned about the computational burden of performing timestamp truncations and/or conversions at query time
* Often, users interacting with your models will do so through a BI tool rather than raw SQL, and any BI tool worth its salt handles timestamp truncation and timezone conversions easily.
* This approach does not necessarily prioritize the computational burden (i.e. brain time :wink:) of analysts using the warehouse. Adding extra fields, especially for time parts, can bloat models, degrading the information architecture. Building those fields in the first place can lead to extra code, when it's likely your BI tool can do it for you.

So, if you're using a modern data stack, and not strictly married to Kimball style modeling, how should you handle your timestamps? Well, like a lot of  things, it depends on your situation. Below is some consolidated advice based on what we've seen in the amazing [dbt Slack](http://ac-slackin.herokuapp.com/)¹.

### If you are consistently reporting from one timezone:
- Store timestamps in UTC
- Perform timezone conversion in your BI tool
- Perform timestamp truncation in your BI tool 

This represents the simplest approach, and for many organizations, is the best option. Use this approach until it doesn't work.


### If you are rolling up your data by a date part (e.g. `daily signups`) OR using a timestamp in a join to another model:
- If you are doing timestamp conversions and/or truncations in your select statements when aggregating data in your models², à la: 
```
select
date_trunc('day', convert_timezone('EST', created_at)) as date_est
, count(*) as number_of_signups
from users
```
- Or if you are doing timestamp conversions and/or truncations in your join conditions when joining to a table at a different grain:
```
select
orders.id
, calendar.business_day
from orders
left join calendar on calendar.date_est = date_trunc('day', convert_timezone('EST', orders.created_at))
```
- You might consider doing this calculation in an upstream model, so that your models look like:
```
select
created_date_est
, count(*) as number_of_signups
from users
```
```
select
orders.id
, calendar.business_day
from orders
left join calendar on calendar.date_est = orders.created_date_est
```
- If implementing this approach, it's likely a good idea to still provide UTC timestamps alongside the target timezone timestamps in your warehouse.

### If you have different timezones for different records within the same model OR the local context is important:
- It may be useful to store timestamps in both UTC and the local timezone. Each timestamp should be suffixed `_utc` and `_local` respectively.
- Additionally, it may be useful to store the local timezone (e.g. `'EST'`) for each record in a `local_timezone` field.
- You may be able to use your BI tool to use the `local_timezone` field and the UTC timestamp to convert timestamps to the correct timezone – I recently [wrote](https://discourse.looker.com/t/using-looker-parameters-for-dynamic-timezones/9060) about how I approached this using Looker. For me, this negated the need to store the local timestamp.

### Generally:
- Timezones are _hard_. There's no single best approach, so choose one that makes sense for your organization.
- Consistency is key – whatever approach you do choose, use it consistently throughout all your models.
- If you are using timezones other than UTC (or even if you are using UTC but want to be explicit), _suffix_ (as opposed to prefix) your timestamps with the timezones. For example, the fields `created_at_utc` and `created_at_est` are preferable to `utc_created_at` and `est_created_at`. Most BI tools order things alphabetically so using suffixes keeps the two fields together in a list, improving your information architecture.

²Generally consider whether you should be doing this pre-aggregation in your warehouse as opposed to in your BI tool. Pre-aggregating often limits the ability to explore the data, but is required in cases, for example rolling up daily revenue to compare actuals to sales targets, where sales targets are defined at a daily level.",1

Build the image from a location where your authentication files are present, so they can be copied into your image.  I have a little EC2 instance for just this purpose, so I don't have service account credentials proliferating onto a bunch of engineer laptops.  From the desired folder, I run `docker build --pull -t dbtdocs .`

I can deploy that image to ECR if I want, but I run it from the image build machine (it's idle most of the time anyway; might as well give it something else to do!) To start serving the site, I run `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart unless-stopped dbtdocs`

Assuming your network settings allow it, now you can hit port 8080 on that machine and your docs site should be visible.

I went a step further, however, to SSL-ify the connection.  I use a EC2 HTTPS load balancer (because it makes it easy to deal with certificates and whatnot) listening on port 443 (as expected) and it routes all traffic to the docker host's 8080, where the docker host will then route it to the docker container's 8080, where `dbt docs generate` is serving the content.

* The first time through doing the load balancer and security group config was a bit hairy - I've done it a few times now, so it's not a big deal now, but that first time wasn't trivial.  A better engineer than me would make a CloudFormation template for this.
* Expects that I have a subdomain that I can point to the load balancer (since the subdomain is what the SSL cert is applied to). I _do_ but that's not a given for some organizations.
* It doesn't do user auth, relying on the doubleplusungood assumption that anyone on my office wifi is authorized to see the docs.  I hope to add an oAuth portal at some point.  Until then, I just have to be mindful of what I put in the docs.",2

I'm also thinking about authentication, you're already using a load balancer; it is possible to set up the load balancer to do auth with Cognito e.g. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html#cognito-requirements
Cognito supports a bunch of different SSO integrations, would be worth looking at.",3
141,"publishing-dbt-docs-from-a-docker-container","Just wanted to chip in here and describe my train of thoughts and solution.

In the docs section, you can see [4 possibilities](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/documentation-website#section-deploying-the-documentation-site), presumably ranked by the authors' preference.
My personal ranking is :

1. **dbt cloud** or **netlify**: fully managed CI/CD option but you have to pay at one point or another
1. ""spin up a **webserver** like nginx"": in other words deploy the static website the way you would deploy any other static website (think sites generated by frameworks like jekyll or hugo)
1. **S3 bucket**

In a case where pricing is an issue and engineering resources/knowledge are available, *I even would swap 2 for 1*.

In the situation you want to achieve 2, you need 3 things:

* a docker image that can build and serve the static website
* a CI that can build the docker image on any new commit and push it to a repository
* an ""environment"" in which to deploy your docker image: whether it is a server on which you pull the image, or kubernetes if you have a cluster setup

Let's assume you have the last 2 steps ready from your other production services, and let's focus on the first step: **build and serve** the static website.

The best way I've found to do this is to leverage [docker multistage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/). In other words, you first build and then serve. The image to build your website is a python based image with dbt installed, that will run `dbt docs generate`. The image to serve your website will be a web-server based image (in my case I use nginx) that copies over the static files generated in the previous step and serves them.

For the Dockerfile itself, there are a few specificities to each project to I can't share a turnkey Dockerfile, but here is the structure:
```bash
# build site
FROM python:3.7-slim as dbt_site_builder

# here add the environment variables you need and will pass via --build-arg 
ARG ...  

# install dbt
ENV DBT_VERSION=0.14.2
RUN apt-get update -y && \
    apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y -q \
    git libpq-dev python-dev && \
    pip install dbt==${DBT_VERSION}

# Set environment variables and working directory
ENV DBT_DIR /source
WORKDIR $DBT_DIR
ENV DBT_PROFILES_DIR $DBT_DIR
COPY . .

# pull dbt dependencies
RUN dbt deps

# build static pages
RUN dbt docs generate

# serve site
FROM nginx:stable-alpine

# here copy any nginx related files you might need for your deployment, for example nginx.conf
ADD ...

COPY --from=dbt_site_builder /source/target/index.html /source/target/manifest.json /source/target/catalog.json /source/target/run_results.json /usr/share/nginx/html/

EXPOSE 80
```

If you use any creative dbt testing approaches, continuous integration/deployment, automation of SQL tests through a workflow tool like Airflow, or otherwise, I would love to hear about it! How do you test?",1
149,"how-do-you-test-your-data","This is a really good question, and something that we've been asking ourselves more recently. We add the typical unique/not null test constraints, and some relationship tests between our models. A more recent ""test type"" we've incorporated are regression tests. This is especially useful for us when we find a bug in our code with unintended consequences. Before attempting to ""fix"" the issue we write a test that catches the bug and then attempt to fix the code, which is similar to test-driven development.",2
149,"how-do-you-test-your-data","Hey @joshtemple - we use testing in a few different capacities. 

1. During development

When creating or modifying a table, I like to add tests for some invariants, like the uniqueness or non-nullness of a given column. This helps me gain confidence that the code which I am writing works as intended. @kriselle makes a great point about TDD above too. For well-defined models, I like to write my tests _first_, then build a model around the tests. This flow helps reduce the friction around merging PRs... more on that below.

2. During PRs

We've built build-on-PR functionality into [sinter](sinterdata.com). Whenever a Pull Request is made against our internal-analytics repo, Sinter will kick off a full run & test of our dbt project in a scratch schema. If any of the models or tests fail, then Sinter puts a big red X on the Pull Request. If everything works as intended, then Sinter shows a nice green check mark. The contextualized test success/failures help guide code review, and acts as a last check before code gets merged into production. In practice, it looks like this:

![46%20AM|690x335](upload://iM2ORcOrg121Bsa7nZr5Pmy9N9D.png) 

3. In production

We also use Sinter to run our models on a scheduled basis. A typical deployment of dbt includes running:
```
dbt seed
dbt run
dbt test
```

So, after every invocation of `dbt run`, we also run all of the tests in the project. If any of these steps fail, we get email notifications from Sinter. This helps alerts us when bad/invalid data has arrived from a data source, or when some logic in a model doesn't hold up over time.

There's lots more to say about testing, deployment, CI, etc. I know many dbt users are doing pretty interesting/complex things. You should cross-post this to #general in Slack :)",3
149,"how-do-you-test-your-data","I would like to echo Drew's sentiments above. I would like to add two thoughts.

**During Development**

Before working on an existing model, I like to take a couple of key metrics about it- things like row count, sum of key columns (e.g. revenue), and count of distinct values in other columns. If the number of rows in the beginning and the end of the development process don't match, that's fine, but I need to be able to justify the change. 

**After Development**
_This is not yet something we've implemented, but it's something we hope to implement soon._

 I think a summary metrics table is a good idea. Pick 10 or so key business metrics from a bunch of different data sources and decide on some tolerance for change. If yesterday's values are outside of that tolerance for change, have a test fail. A little bit of noise (too rapid growth? slow holiday weekend? etc) is better than a problem with data that your end-user discovers first.

I've spent a lot of time lately thinking about _what CI looks like for data_. Thanks for starting the conversation.",4
149,"how-do-you-test-your-data","Thank you all for your input!

We have a similar setup where we use GitLab CI to create and test the entire data model in a build schema before merging into master. We also trigger our GitLab pipeline for daily runs after our EL jobs finish, which executes `dbt seed/run/test` in a build schema, then `dbt seed/run` in production if the tests pass.

**This is helpful if issues with newly loaded source data cause a test to fail. The side effect of this is that if a single test fails, we don't update our production schema at all, since we don't have a good way to pass/fail specific models and promote the results to production.** I would be interested to hear if anyone else has thought of a better way to do that.

@emilie, I like your idea of checking a few ""health"" metrics during and after development. At a previous company, we had a daily email that displayed the difference in record count between today and yesterday for each table. Even that simple count helped us catch a lot of issues.",5

155,"ctes-are-passthroughs-some-research","Hi all! I recently did some research on a question that comes up when I talk to people about SQL and optimizers.

At Fishtown Analytics, we have a [style guide](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/corp/blob/master/dbt_coding_conventions.md) for how we write SQL. Part of that style guide is using CTEs as though they're `import` statements. We start each model by ""importing"" each upstream relation that's going to be used. In practice, that looks like this:

```
with customers as (
  select * from {{ref('fct_customers')}}
),
orders as (
  select * from {{ref('fct_orders')}}
)
...
```
This functions a lot like your imports at the top of a Python script (or any programming language):
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
...
```

This achieves a couple of nice things. First, it makes it very easy to see what the dependencies are for a given model when you first open up its file. Second, it gives you an easy mechanism to consistently alias all input tables—this mechanism ends up being much cleaner than typing out and then aliasing tables individually within each individual CTE. Overall, we've found that this pattern leads to significantly more readable code.

The pattern causes consternation for folks who are familiar with database optimizers on older databases. Lots of CTEs, and lots of `select *`, neither of which is a good idea according to conventional wisdom. I've always believed that this is no longer true with modern analytic databases (BQ, Snowflake, Redshift), but I hadn't done the detailed work to validate that. Until now.

I wrote two versions of a query. The first selects directly from a raw `order_items` table and does a simple aggregation on it. Here's what that looks like with the associated Redshift explain plan:

![49%20PM|690x98](upload://59u42BVFZlJYc7P9Cg6QUVAIZLX.png) 

The second passes the source data through *ten CTEs* before finally doing an aggregation on it. Here's what each looks like (along with the associated Redshift explain plan:

![51%20PM|690x98](upload://fs9v9o5oKALZHLtX4wQrBmRDcUj.png) 

The thing you'll note about these two explain plans is that _they are identical_. Redshift doesn't care if you pass the source data through 10 ""obfuscating"" CTEs, each of which select every single column in the underlying table. It ""optimizes through"" the CTEs and understands what the user is actually asking for: a simple count distinct on top of a single column. **The other columns in the table don't get used in the plan at all.**

OK, great. Redshift treats CTEs as pass-throughs. Let's prove that the same is true of Bigquery and Snowflake. BigQuery first. Here are the two explain plans (first a direct query, second with 10 passthrough CTEs):

![48%20PM|690x166](upload://i2NJms29YG9D8PoQqnd4wKPwNeV.png) 

![58%20PM|690x167](upload://nRLmm2YU5b7BCOEzjwPYq6inZTw.png) 

Because BQ is a shared resource, two queries' execution will never be exactly identical. These are as close to identical execution plans as you can really get. On to Snowflake:

![55%20PM|612x500](upload://3GX6iVdpFniykqJrtQmTFW4hgoE.png) 

![17%20PM|603x500](upload://poSVR9B8VupCBIkMM5RfXOBoKHp.png) 

This one is slightly more perplexing--the second query (with the CTEs) is actually faster! That doesn't make a ton of sense to me, but I also ran this query second and my guess is that I wasn't able to fully invalidate the cache for the second run. More importantly though, the explain plan is identical across both runs--Snowflake treats the queries as identical from an optimizer perspective.

## Summary
All modern analytical database optimizers appear to treat our ""import statement"" CTEs as pass-throughs. These CTEs have no impact on performance whatsoever, and just act in the way that we want: as a great tool to clean up our code but not ultimately to change the explain plan.",1

159,"how-to-create-a-series-of-python-udfs-for-parsing-user-agents-in-redshift","What follows is a step-by-step guide to creating a series of Python UDFs on Redshift for parsing user agents with Python's [`user-agents`](https://github.com/selwin/python-user-agents) module. While our ultimate goal will be efficiently parsing user agents in Redshift, the first few steps are generalizable to building custom UDFs with any custom Python module (though your results may vary based on the complexities of the module you're trying to use!).

## 1. Package up your python dependencies

When adding custom Python modules to your Redshift cluster, you need to first consider how Python modules work, and how they might possibly work on your cluster. Most modules rely on a series of other modules, which are loaded at runtime by looking at your machine's `PATH`. In most cases, `pip` handles this dependency resolution without us having to worry about it. But since we can't just open up our cluster's terminal and type `pip install user-agents`, we have to do something a bit more complicated.  

We'll follow AWS Lab's [PipLibraryInstaller](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-redshift-udfs/tree/master/bin/PipLibraryInstaller) guide, though we won't use their provided script so as to encourage greater understanding of what's going on under the hood. We'll walk through each step of the process. While you're encouraged to try and abstract these steps out into your own script, my personal experience has shown that different modules require different installation strategies. I also doubt you'll ever do this more than a handful of times per cluster, so it's not clear what you're saving by automating this process (unless you're in the business of managing clusters for other people, then by all means, automate!).

First, we need to build a `wheel` of `user-agents`. A [`wheel`](https://fileinfo.com/extension/whl) file is the standard built-package format used for python and is essentially just a `zip` file of the module's code and metadata. To do this let's run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p tmp/
pip wheel user-agents --no-cache-dir --wheel-dir tmp/user-agents/
```
We should now be able to inspect the specified `wheel-dir` and see the following:
```bash
ls tmp/user-agents/
>>> ua_parser-0.8.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl user_agents-1.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
**NOTE**: As you can see, `pip wheel` generated two files when packaging up `user-agents`, one for the module itself, and one for  `ua_parser`, the module it depends on. 

To add these modules to Redshift, we need to upload both files to S3 using the [`awscli`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/), which you can install via `pip install --user awscli`.

```bash
aws s3 cp tmp/ua-parser/ua_parser-0.8.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl \ 
 s3://my-bucket/ua-parser.zip
aws s3 cp tmp/ua-parser/user_agents-1.1.0-py3-none-any.whl \ 
 s3://my-bucket/user-agents.zip
```
**NOTE**: The above commands might be slightly different depending on the version of `user-agents` you install. 

## 2. Add your modules to Redshift 

After uploading your module to S3, we can now add it to our Redshift cluster by executing the following SQL statements:

```sql
CREATE LIBRARY ua_parser
LANGUAGE plpythonu
from 's3://my-bucket/ua-parser.zip'
WITH CREDENTIALS AS 'aws_access_key_id={my_key};aws_secret_access_key={my_secret}'

CREATE LIBRARY user_agents
LANGUAGE plpythonu
from 's3://my-bucket/user_agents.zip'
WITH CREDENTIALS AS 'aws_access_key_id={my_key};aws_secret_access_key={my_secret}'
```
**NOTE**: Replace `{my_key}` and `{my_secret}` with your AWS credentials. You can also use an `iam_role` here. 

## 3. Write your UDFs

Next, we'll attempt to test our module by writing our UDFs. We'll follow Amazon's [best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/udf-naming-udfs.html) for naming UDFs by placing them in a custom schema and prefixing the function name with `f_`:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA udf;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION udf.f_ua_is_bot(ua VARCHAR(MAX)) RETURNS boolean IMMUTABLE as $$
  if ua is None or ua == '': return False
  from user_agents import parse; return parse(ua).is_bot
$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION udf.f_ua_browser(ua VARCHAR(MAX)) RETURNS VARCHAR(MAX) IMMUTABLE as $$
  if ua is None or ua == '': return None
  from user_agents import parse; return parse(ua).browser.family
$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION udf.f_ua_browser_version(ua VARCHAR(MAX)) RETURNS VARCHAR(MAX) IMMUTABLE as $$
  if ua is None or ua == '': return None
  from user_agents import parse; return parse(ua).browser.version_string
$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION udf.f_ua_device_brand(ua VARCHAR(MAX)) RETURNS VARCHAR(MAX) IMMUTABLE as $$
  if ua is None or ua == '': return None
  from user_agents import parse; return parse(ua).device.brand
$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION udf.f_ua_device_family(ua VARCHAR(MAX)) RETURNS VARCHAR(MAX) IMMUTABLE as $$
  if ua is None or ua == '': return None
  from user_agents import parse; return parse(ua).device.family
$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION udf.f_ua_device_model(ua VARCHAR(MAX)) RETURNS VARCHAR(MAX) IMMUTABLE as $$
  if ua is None or ua == '': return None
  from user_agents import parse; return parse(ua).device.model
$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION udf.f_ua_os_family(ua VARCHAR(MAX)) RETURNS VARCHAR(MAX) IMMUTABLE as $$
  if ua is None or ua == '': return None
  from user_agents import parse; return parse(ua).os.family
$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION udf.f_ua_os_version(ua VARCHAR(MAX)) RETURNS VARCHAR(MAX) IMMUTABLE as $$
  if ua is None or ua == '': return None
  from user_agents import parse; return parse(ua).os.version_string
$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu;
```

## 3. Testing your UDFs

You should now be able to use these UDFs in queries to parse user agent strings:

```
SELECT udf.f_ua_is_bot('Twitterbot');
>>> True
SELECT udf.f_ua_is_bot('Mozilla/1234');
>>> False
```

## 4. Optimizing your use of UDFs

One thing to know about UDFs is that they're extremely slow. Think about what's happening under the hood: Your database is basically piping a string out to another process and capturing the result. This will not be anywhere near as fast as a normal query. As a result you need to thoroughly optimize your user agent parsing queries to _minimize the number of rows it operates on_. Here are a few strategies:

### Only parse distinct user agents.

Instead of naively running your UDF on every user agent string in your data warehouse, build a lookup table of unique user agents to user agent metadata, then join against this table when you want to enrich your user agent strings with additional metadata. You can also hash the user-agent string in order to speed up future joins on this table:

```sql
strtol(left(func_sha1(user_agent), 15), 16)::bigint
```

### Don't re-parse user agent strings

Instead of re-building this table everyday from scratch, identify the new user-agent strings that show up every day and add these to your lookup table.

## 5. Managing UDF permissions

Follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/udf-security-and-privileges.html) to allow other DB users to access your UDFs.

## 6. Integrating with DBT

Follow @claire's excellent guide for integrating UDFs into your DBT workflow: https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions-redshift/18",1
181,"examples-of-custom-schema-tests","I'm really diving into data testing at the moment (thanks to @joshtemple's [Medium post](https://medium.com/@josh.temple/automated-testing-in-the-modern-data-warehouse-d5a251a866af)!). By default, dbt comes with 4 schema tests: not null, unique, relationships, and accepted values. Also, dbt allows for [custom schema test](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/custom-schema-tests) which lets you define additional schema tests. 

**I'm interested in how others have defined custom schema tests for their data models.** It'd be great to have several examples here to inspire the rest of us in brainstorming data tests that fit our data needs. 

For example, I work with North American phone numbers a lot, so I have a custom schema tests to check that phone number fields always contain ten-digit number (TDN) strings: 

```
{# Verifies all elements in field are TDNs. If validation_errors returns >0 rows, test fails. #}

{% macro test_is_tdn(model, column_name) %}

with validation as (
  select
    {{ column_name }} as tdn_field
  from {{ model }}
),

validation_errors as (
  select
    tdn_field
  from validation

* **Equality for range** test that two tables have the same data in them, for the rows in the given id range. This is useful for testing against a controlled data set, as it allows you to test specific use cases on a subset of data while having other data in the model that may be used by other tests.
* **Has timestamp** and **Has version** are tests that ensure that certain design patterns we have are enforced. For example, we have (had) a rule that every denormalised table or foreign key in a model should have its own timestamp column, which is then used for incremental updates later. This test ensures that a given column has a matching timestamp column, and that the timestamp column has a value in it whenever it needs to.
* **Null when parent column null** This is a junk-data/model design test. It ensures that when you denormalise a table, its columns are either all populated or (in the event that the foreign key was null) all not populated.",3

193,"validating-the-sql-in-a-redshift-late-binding-view","## Why Redshift's late-binding views are great
Redshift's late-binding views ""unbinds"" a view from the data it selects from. In practice, this means that if upstream views or tables are dropped with a `cascade` qualifier, the late-binding view does _not_ get dropped as well.

Using late-binding views in a production deployment of dbt can vastly improve the availability of data in the warehouse, especially for models that are materialized as late-binding views and are queried by end-users, since they won’t be dropped when upstream models are updated.

For more information on late-binding views, see the [docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/warehouse-specific-configurations#section-late-binding-views) and this [blogpost](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/using-redshifts-late-binding-views-with-dbt-e735d80f9cfc).

## Why Redshift's late-binding views are not so great
One downside of using late-binding views is that if the SQL in your view is invalid, it may only be picked up when a query that returns results from this view is executed – while Redshift will detect syntax errors in your SQL straight away, if you happen to use an incorrect column name or table name in your query, or forget to give a calculated column an alias, it will still create the view for you anyway!

For models in your dbt project that have downstream models materialized as tables, this error will be raised during the execution of the downstream model, making it harder to diagnose where your bad SQL exists. And if your late-binding view is exposed to an end user, you may not realize you have bad SQL until someone queries it!

## Validating the SQL in your late-binding view
Fortunately, you can leverage post-hooks and macros so check whether a late-binding views contain valid SQL by selecting a single row from your model. Note that this _will_ slow down your dev runs of dbt, so use it with caution!

With the following macro, if you’re in dev, and your model is a late-binding view, a query that selects a row from the view will be executed.
```sql
-- macros/test_late_binding_view_in_dev.sql
{% macro test_late_binding_view_in_dev() -%}

    {%- set is_late_binding_view=
        model['config']['materialized'] == 'view'
        and model['config']['bind'] == False
    -%}

    {%- set is_dev = (target.name == 'dev') -%}

    {%- if is_dev and is_late_binding_view -%}

        select * from {{ this }} limit 1

    {%- else -%}

        select 1 as test

    {%- endif -%}

{%- endmacro %}
```
By calling this as a post hook for each model, this macro will catch any bad SQL before moving on to the next model, raising an error for the model with the invalid SQL, and skipping downstream models.
```yaml
models:
  bind: false
  post-hook:
    - ""{{ jaffle_shop.test_late_binding_view_in_dev() }}""
```

Notes:
* I have decided to only test this when in dev, to reduce my prod run time.
* I namespaced my macro in the post-hook definition so that this macro works for my installed packages
* As an alternative solution, I also investigated setting the `bind` parameter based on the target so views would only be late-binding in prod. I couldn't get that appraoch to work due to the way dbt parses the `dbt_project.yml` file.",1
211,"structure-snowflake-database-schema","Hey! Are there any best practices on Snowflake on how to structure your database / schema? In conventional databases, you're not really able to query data from multiple databases. Usually, we've been having one schema per data sources (raw) and one schema for cleaned data sources (etl).

I was wondering what's the common approach on Snowflake to structure those datasets?

Using Segment data as an example, I'm thinking of two main ways to approach this:

> a)
> Database: segment_data
> Schema: raw_website_data
> Schema: raw_mobile_data
> 
> Schema: etl_website_data
> Schema: etl_mobile_data

> b)
> Database: raw_segment_data
> Schema: website_data
> Schema: mobile_data
> 
> Database: etl_segment_data
> Schema: website_data
> Schema: mobile_data

What are your thoughts?",1
211,"structure-snowflake-database-schema","I do not know what's ""common"", but we decided on a few things when setting ours up:

1. We use databases to separate user role permissions (`raw` for loaders to load raw data, `dbt_dev` for analysts to build development dbt models, and `analytics` for our production models). 

2. The `raw` database houses our raw data as ingested by connectors. Connectors use the `loader` role, which is the only role with write access to this db, and it does not have access to any other db. The schemas in this database are named with a `{source}_{connector}` convention (eg `salesforce_stitch`). The purpose here is twofold, 1) It makes it easy to identify which connector is being used to ingest the data, and 2) It removes any naming conflict awkwardness when changing a source connector (eg if moving to Fivetran we would just create `salesforce_fivetran`):

`raw.salesforce_stitch.leads`
`raw.delighted_stitch.responses`
`raw.paycom_airflow.employees`, etc.

3. The `dbt_dev` database is for (surprise) our analysts to develop dbt models. Each analyst has a namespaced default schema (eg `dbt_dev.dpearce`). Analysts use the `transformer` role, which has read access to all dbs but can only write to the `dbt_dev` database.

`dbt_dev.dpearce`
`dbt_dev.dpearce_base`, etc.

4. Finally, the `analytics` database is for our production models. We separate our base tables and transformed models into different schemas (`analytics.base` and `analytics.analytics`). Our `base` models use a naming convention of `{source_table}`. Only our Sinter account can write to this database. Our BI tool (Looker) is read-only and only has access to the `analytics.analytics` schema. So:

`analytics.base.freshdesk_agents`
`analytics.base.paycom_employees`
`analytics.base.salesforce_users`

`analytics.analytics.employees`, etc.",2
211,"structure-snowflake-database-schema","After debating the idea in my head and reading further documentation on warehouses (effectively database), wouldn't it be more manageable to have one data source being reflected as one warehouse?

Let's say that we have 3 ""connections"": Segment, Stitch, Luigi.

We would then have

`segment.source_name.table_name`
`stitch.source_name.table_name`
`luigi.source_name.table_name`

Then we could scale up or down these warehouses individually! Let's imagine that we have an influx of Frontend events and we need to scale up the Segment database for better processing, then it would only affect that source of data instead of potentially scaling up for every data sources in the example of the ""raw"" database containing everything.

Have you hit issues or slowdown by having all the ""connector"" syncs into the same database? @dapearce",3
211,"structure-snowflake-database-schema","""Warehouses"" and ""databases"" are not the same thing within Snowflake. A database in Snowflake really just represents a storage partition, while warehouses are compute resources. 

You can have multiple warehouses processing data in the same ""database"" concurrently. For example, you can have a ""segment"" warehouse writing to the ""raw"" database at the same time a ""stitch"" warehouse is writing to the ""raw"" database. I am not aware of any scaling considerations with ""databases"" within Snowflake.

211,"structure-snowflake-database-schema","I love this question @cab – thanks so much for posting it to Discourse. I've included some advice for folks that aren't on Snowflake too.

I totally agree with @dapearce's reply!

We often leverage the `raw.<source>.*` pattern on Snowflake (often, all our data sources are loaded by the same tool, but I can see the utility in including `<connector>`!). Note for warehouses where you can't do cross-database queries (read: Redshift), I recommend using a `raw_<source>.*` pattern to get a similar result.

In terms of databases/schemas for objects built by dbt, in snowflake we often use an `analytics.<mart>.*` pattern. On Redshift, I like to use a pattern like `zone_<mart>.*` so the schemas get ordered nicely in your warehouse, but that's my own preference! 

Personally, I'd steer clear of using separate databases for each source (or collection of sources) in Snowflake, it feels like it would add too much complexity to the design without much benefit.",6
211,"structure-snowflake-database-schema","Thanks for doing this.

I'm curious about Warehouse naming and convention. Perhaps a new thread required (please let me know), but if not:
I've setup two warehouses `etl_wh` and `query_wh` per [this article](https://medium.com/hashmapinc/snowflakes-cloud-data-warehouse-what-i-learned-and-why-i-m-rethinking-the-data-warehouse-75a5daad271c), and I've setup all ETL tools + dbt to have permissions on `etl_wh` and I'll setup users and BI tools to use `query_wh`. 

Will this scale? How are are you thinking about warehouses. There is very little in the public domain about this type of stuff, so very useful to hear your thoughts.",7
211,"structure-snowflake-database-schema","@matt we have been incrementally switching over from Redshift and have thus far gotten by with a single small warehouse for everything. However, we are basically at our limit there now and will need to break it out soon. So my first-hand experience is so far limited but my understanding of warehouses is you want to consider a few things:

1. The biggest cost with Snowflake is warehouse usage, which is dependent on a combination of the size of the warehouse and how many minutes it runs.

2. The bigger the warehouse, the faster things run. So it's very possible a big query can be cheaper to run on a large warehouse than a small, because although a large warehouse costs more per minute to run, the query takes less time to run than on a small warehouse.

It's recommended to [configure a warehouse to auto-suspend](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/warehouses-overview.html#auto-suspension-and-auto-resumption). This will pause the warehouse after a specified period of inactivity (thus stop the billing).

For us, because of how Stitch loads data it is running a small warehouse almost 24/7, but not using the full capacity of the warehouse. So we have so far been able to get by with our dbt modeling and BI tool on the same warehouse without too much issue (thus minimizing our billing costs). However, we moved over some of our data science jobs and are pretty close to separating things out now.

What's ""best"" is likely different for a lot of organizations. For example, if you have some data science models that run once a week that use a lot of compute, but infrequently, you may assign them their own XL warehouse, which you only get billed for when they run. If you have a lot of BI users and want to ensure they never compete with ingestion or data science computing you could give the BI tool it's own warehouse.

However, if you give Stitch it's own warehouse, and Segment it's own warehouse, and Looker it's own warehouse, and dbt it's own warehouse, and Airflow it's own warehouse, and the most any of these ever use is 20% of the compute capacity then you've probably over-optimized and are paying more than you need to.

With that in mind, I think warehouse naming conventions are probably dependent on what you are assigning them to. I think what you have makes sense if you just want to make sure BI users aren't impacted by ETL compute, and you can get by with a single warehouse for ETL compute. Warehouses are also pretty easy to create and delete and reassign so I think the consequences of warehouse naming conventions aren't the same as with a database.",8
211,"structure-snowflake-database-schema","Perfect, thank you, that makes sense.

[quote=""dapearce, post:8, topic:211""]

[/quote]

I'm not sure I understand the billing well enough, but is it not the case that compute resources are strictly pay-per-use, so that even if each tool had it's own warehouse, you would only pay for the use of each warehouse, and not the fact that they exist? (assuming parity of warehouse size).",9
211,"structure-snowflake-database-schema","@matt, correct, you only pay for the time that you use each warehouse, not that they exist. So you can have as many warehouses as you want, and if they aren't running you won't be billed anything.

The consideration comes with when and how much they are being utilized. For example, let's consider your data loading usage (Stitch) and your dbt usage (Sinter or Airflow). 

You can give each of them their own small warehouse to ensure they don't compete with each other. Or you can put them on the same warehouse. Which to choose?

Let's say they both are scheduled to run at the top of the hour. Stitch runs for 15 minutes and dbt runs for 10 minutes. If you put them on separate warehouses you will be billed:

stitch_wh: 15 mins X 24 hours = 360 mins/day
sinter_wh: 10 mins X 24 hours = 240 mins/day
Total: 600 mins/day

However, do they need to be on separate warehouses? If they each only use 20% compute, then you could put them on the same warehouse and they would still only use 40% of the compute (meaning you could probably put your BI tool on there too).

In this scenario, they both still run at the top of the hour, and both still take the same amount of time to complete, but you are only running one warehouse and since they run concurrently you are only billed for the max 15/mins per hour that Stitch uses (Sinter's 10mins overlaps with this), so:

shared_wh: 15 mins * 24 hours = total 360 mins/day (much cheaper)

Of course, if Sinter's run is scheduled for half-past the hour, because you want to run it AFTER your Stitch load, then they would not run concurrently, and your billed minutes would be the same with one warehouse as it is for two (in this case it's really no benefit either way, since they wouldn't compete even on a shared warehouse).

So when scaling, yes, warehouse strategy can become complicated. You may need to consider the number of concurrent queries, the amount of compute needed, the priority of the job or the importance of how fast it's completed, etc.

If you have a simple setup my recommendation is just put it all on a small warehouse. Make sure each piece of the system uses its own Snowflake user, then once you start to hit performance issues you can dig into usage per user and consider moving one or more users to separate warehouses.",10
211,"structure-snowflake-database-schema","@dapearce thank you, that is a great explanation, and certainly new insight for me. I'll stick to a single warehouse for now, as reducing cost is initial priority.",11

@crholliday you don't need to do anything in this files to allow dbt to connect to different databases. You just need to make sure the dbt user has permissions to access the different databases. You just query them by including the database in the selector:
```
SELECT * FROM database1.schema.table

LEFT JOIN database2.schema.table USING (join_key)
```
If you are talking about ensuring dbt builds to the correct database (developers build to `dbt_dev` but production builds to `analytics`), then you just specify that in the `database` parameter of the `profiles.yml`. Here's what our `profiles.yml` template looks like:
```
snowflake:
  outputs:
    # This is the dev profile. Configure it by adding
    # your Snowflake username and password, and setting a
    # default dev schema for your dbt models.
    dev:
      type: snowflake

We use dbt Cloud to build our production models, so our configuration there is to build to our `analytics` database.

211,"structure-snowflake-database-schema","David, thanks for sharing your modeling outline. I’m doing some more reading on modeling methods/standards and was curious if your above description has evolved over the last year.

Specifically, I’m curious if you (or anyone) explored an architecture like `analytics.base_{source}.{table}` , or possibly a three-db approach of `raw` , `staging` , and `analytics`? i.e. something that maintains schemas per source, even for base tables.

I keep thinking that having **all** base models end up in the `analytics.base` schema will create lots of clutter — am I missing something, some trade off or unexpected advantages? It seems the standard is to go with a two-DB (`raw` & `analytics` approach based on [1]), as you've outlined, so I'd love to hear comments on why going beyond this is not recommended.

I found an PR [2] that introduces the ability to route models to a specific database, so having the ability to read from `raw` and then output base models to `base.{source}.{table}` while having all analytics-related models go to an `analytics` DB might not be too hard to manage.

Would love to hear thoughts on this or any reference to other useful examples. Thanks in advance

At that time, the primary reason we put base and analytic models in a single schema was to simplify permissions. If we had analytic models in multiple schemas, and base models in multiple schemas (within the same database), then anytime we want to add new schemas, or change permissions, it would be difficult to manage. 

Of course, with the ability to configure dbt to build to multiple databases, permissions can be maintained at the database level. This can certainly provide for an additional level of organization.

Since I have not tried this in practice, I may be overlooking something, but to answer your question no I don't see any immediate concerns or tradeoffs with this approach. I think it's particularly appealing in a *very* large project. With that said, we have ~250 models in our project and have not found our current setup to be cumbersome or difficult to manage.

225,"is-kimball-dimensional-modeling-still-relevant-in-a-modern-data-warehouse","So in Kimball modeling there were some assumptions made in1996 that just aren't true in 2019:

1) Databases are slow and expensive 
2) SQL language is limited
3) You can never join fact tables because of one to many or many to one joins 
4) Businesses are slow to change

A lot has happened:

1) databases are now fast and cheap
2) SQL has evolved to include many more date functions and window functions that cut down on ETL work required
3) Looker solved this with Symmetric Aggregates 
4) Business doesn't wait for you to finish your perfect DWH

So I respect the work of Kimball and there are some great tips and techniques in the DWH Toolkit that I use everyday. But I see too many ""over engineered"" data warehouses that don't need to be that complex and don't encompass new things happening in the business.",5
225,"is-kimball-dimensional-modeling-still-relevant-in-a-modern-data-warehouse","The ""core"" of Kimball to me is based on a few ideas:

1. Users will need to query data in any number of different ways, but fully normalized data models are way too complex for non-developers to deal with. So we need a simpler way to model data for analytics.
2. We need to think about dimensions in a conformed way. if you are slicing a bunch of facts by, say, customer, it needs to be the same, common list of customers no matter how many different things you slice it by. Otherwise users across the business eventually start getting inconsistent results and then everybody loses faith in the accuracy of the data in the warehouse. And no, denormalizing all of your dimensions down into every fact is not a good solution when you have 30 facts and 30 dimensions in a DW of respectable size.
3. We need to model data in such a way that when we add new data it doesn't break existing reports and analytics. This means making sure we think thoroughly about the grain of all things ahead of time. If we change the existing columns or the grain, especially the grain, it's going to break a lot of existing stuff. Well, maybe you can change things if you work in a small shop, but in an Enterprise Data Warehouse with hundreds or thousands of users, getting everybody to change their existing analytics takes literally years.
4. But, after #3 - we are also going to constantly find new data and reports. So we have to make sure that we have modeled in a way that allows us to add new data.
5. We need a consistent conceptual way to get people to think about events we analyze (facts) versus the things we are analyzing them by so that we aren't reinventing the wheel every time we go to build data models. I can tell everytime I see a DW or analytics solution built by somebody who doesn't understand this and doesn't follow some approach (whether Kimball or Inmon) because it's invariably some crazy denormalization approach that is internally inconsistent and impossible to explain in an organized way. Or even worse they've just imported all the fully normalized datasets from the source and point the reports right at the source tables.
6. Users will invariably want to use multiple different BI and query tools to access the same dataset. And you can try to herd them in a certain direction (like Looker) but you'll never get them all. So the DW should be built so that, to the best extent possible, users can still query with the tool of their choice. Which means not relying on BI tools, like Looker, to perform major further transformations of the data in the BI layer. Minor transformations, documentation, labels, etc.? Sure.

Database performance is much better now than it was when Kimball was written , but Kimball's model of conformed dimensional design was not primarily concerned about database performance. I will admit it is helpful in managing performance and he discusses performance and storage space, but that was a secondary benefit and regardless of that the primary use cases for it are still relevant.",6
225,"is-kimball-dimensional-modeling-still-relevant-in-a-modern-data-warehouse","Here’s my chaos modeling special blueprint:

1. Raw - Ingest as raw with Fivetran / Stitch / Matillion / Custom Stages, making sure to have an ingestion time and pulling out expected predicate columns if they’re packed in a variant. Strongly prefer append-only ingestion when possible.
2. Stage - All tables named `STG_<SOURCE_TABLE_NAME>` with the most basic cleaning - timestamp conversion, upper/lowercasing of strings, null fills, maybe some basic mapping (like mapping AWS Account Id values to human-readable names using a case statement). These are often views.
3. Analytics - Working from the end of the pipeline, identify use case / pain points and determine the data required for this. Anything a BI tool will hit should be materialized as a table and should have human-readable names with no prefix. Schemas and databases at this level should also be human-readable with schemas split by business function or access level
4. Curated - Iteratively apply DRY concepts to pull useful models out of individual end-table computations and into a curated layer (prepended with `CUR_<TABLE_NAME>`). These are a mix of views and tables and should reference only other curated tables and stage tables. Once you do this a few times, some `CURATED` tables become obvious to you when doing step 3 so you don’t have to go down the path of repeating yourself a ton then reworking backward.

At no point do I normalize incoming sources simply to conform to a formal data model, particularly when I will need to denormalize them by the end of the pipeline.

This approach assumes a smaller data team and a very broad community of mostly BI-focused access. It takes a centralized authority view of the world and doesn’t account for citizen data scientists. This is an approach designed primarily for enterprise clients new to the cloud.

I think formal modeling is very useful, especially in an OLTP environment, but I find that too many large companies that I’ve worked with have gotten obsessed with formal modeling and have completely neglected end-user needs. It has largely been a theatrical exercise that gives the impression of adding value, but at the end of the day we’d spend all our time accommodating some arbitrary modeling needs and end up with no real usage of the warehouse.

I definitely don’t have anything against modeling, I would just prefer to focus efforts on understanding users and delivering value early and intentionally leveraging technical debt in the warehouse in a greenfield cloud data warehouse migration. If we feel the pain of the technical debt, it’ll be due to increases in usage and requirement (ostensibly due to users gaining value) so we can address modeling needs after we’ve delivered value (and using dbt makes it easy to fix this debt). If we don’t feel the pain, then we avoided a costly modeling engagement and can spend all our cycles iterating on use cases to find ways to deliver real value.

I feel like I’m probably in the minority and I’m definitely over biased towards the kinds of projects / companies I’ve worked with.",7
225,"is-kimball-dimensional-modeling-still-relevant-in-a-modern-data-warehouse","I prefer a combination of two approaches: 

1. Some consistent implementation of a normalized model, e.g. any of the ones discussed above. 
2. Flat, denormalized tables built on top which contain the most commonly used facts and dimensions. 

In terms of ownership: 1. is managed by data engineering or more engineering focused analysts, and 2. is managed by a committee of analysts or by a senior analyst. The flat table should aim to cover 80% of use cases, or common queries, for example users, orders, key events etc.. 

For the remaining 20% of use cases, or for new pieces of data and analysis, then the analyst needs to query from tables built in 1. Once an edge case becomes a common query, the facts and dimensions should be added into the flat table.",8

I'm trying to figure if or out how creating Kimball models is different in DBT than it is in the Microsoft world.  Any thoughts?

One implication of ColumnStore indexing to me is that the cost of degenerate dimensions is reduced, which means you might consider using more of them.  If you took this to the extreme it would result in just one big table (OBT), but everyone I've spoken to has seen that this hits a wall at scale.",10

I dont know about this wall, but there are some practical implications for the extreme, where EVERYTHING is in one table... for one, you'll never find anything and there will be many ambiguous columns.",11
225,"is-kimball-dimensional-modeling-still-relevant-in-a-modern-data-warehouse","I think Kimball might not suit mobile app/games for the following reasons:

1 - Needs very fast implementation. Analysts are usually into the field as soon as data regarding engagement is out. A full DWH, even a MVP (say 5-7 dim tables and maybe 2-3 fact tables) would wait for tons of data and would take many weeks for development. It's just not practical.

2 - Columnar database welcomes wide table and hate a lot of joins. Kimball naturally needs a lot of joins for one analysis. Again the DBAs won't be very happy.

I think the most practical method is:
Step 1 - Gather enough requirements (of the analysis) BEFORE the developers start developing the feature

Step 2 - Communicate the requirement (transferred to fields needed so that developers can better understand) to developers and make sure the data contains some connection fields.

Step 3 - When the raw data is out, just import into a raw table with very little transformation

Step 4 - Look at the requirements again, build up a DWH that results in a wide table that analysts don't need to join (or very few joins, <= 3 joins should be good). It's definitely not gonna be Kimball, but each wide table is related to an analysis requirement.

Step 5 - Done and profit. No need to use keys,. Got a data issue? If it's less than say 2% just fix and ignore. Move fast and as long as it doesn't derail it's OK. Worst case we can still fall back to the raw table and rebuild everything.

OK this also has some implicit requirements on the setup of the teams:

1 - The data team (analysts and developers and DBA) should be grouped together and the head should at least be a Director so that he can fight the developers and business sides on equal footing.

2 - Training of any member in the team should include training on all three fields -- analysis, data developer including DE and DWH dev, admin with the right weights. So if you are a data developer, you still get exposed to analysis and admin but 60% of the training goes to developing.

3 - The data developer squadron needs to sync with app developer or project managers on a per Sprint basis. This is to make sure that nothing important is neglected. Before the meeting the data developers should also make sure they consume the requirements taken from the analysts and the suggestions taken from DBA.

4 - You can remove DBA team if data developer does the job.",12
225,"is-kimball-dimensional-modeling-still-relevant-in-a-modern-data-warehouse","It is a great question and one question people should ask when entering data analytics. I'll answer by first providing a question, why do any data modelling at all?
It is an enterprise question, and when you think of the word enterprise you think of large banks or car manufacturers but in fact an enterprise question relates to another discipline, enterprise architecture. The first block of enterprise architecture is business architecture. Here's what I know of business architecture:
It defines business capabilities - these are the building blocks of any business, and the collection of which helps fuel the business strategy (example capabilities are attached)
![typical industry-related business capabilities industry|690x300](upload://90zE0eNTjrlEinzBJIlrNaBTsW4.png)

Each capability may have one or many overlapping business processes, start to finish these are things like onboarding prospects, hardening applications to accounts, processes to deploy one or many accounts for a customer, relating to products and so on. All of these fall under capabilities supporting a strategy right?

Each business process in turn have overlapping business rules, the automated procedures to get work done - unit of work. There is always a data model, Kimball models serve the analytic questions by dividing dimensions and high churn metrics / measures about those measures. The things we care about in the business, products, accounts, customers, clients, plane plants, factories etc. The business objects. Absolutely Kimball has its place! So too does Data Vault 2.0! 
As the the enterprise continues to flex and grow it needs to adapt without refactoring and applying DV2.0 achieves that, Kimball rests on top of DV2.0 to deliver business focussed answers that the DV2.0 stores, DV2.0 recognizes the business objects and business processes, whereas Kimball delivers the analytics needed. They live together. See: [DV2 learning is like learning how to Brew!](https://patrickcuba.medium.com/learning-data-vault-is-like-learning-how-to-make-beer-fff2f7f4d3b)

Where you might be thinking of in terms of other data requirements is real-time data modelling, or no modelling at all! Let me explain, 
Mobile apps needs very fast access to analytical data - explore Kashlev Data Modeller (url: [Portal](http://kdm-portal.weebly.com/)), this takes the data mart and deploys all results to a query-driven data table approach, still the data came from an effort to denormalise the data in the first place!
Data Lake landed data, well to be honest, how did it get there? All data needs data modelling -- data modelling describes the business, after all, it is the third block in enterprise architecture - data architecture, without a business architecture you cannot have a data architecture, what are you modelling?
As for Anchor... it's a cute modelling technique but ask yourself... if you told your Database Administrator you're expecting to manage every column as its own table (6NF) what do you think his/her reaction would be? It may be logically efficient (no nulls) but it is not physically efficient on relational data stores.",13
225,"is-kimball-dimensional-modeling-still-relevant-in-a-modern-data-warehouse","What I'm thinking is that I 100% agree that data should be modelled under business requirements. What I would argue is that we should directly build models that business users can use, instead of dividing them into dim/fact.

Take mobile gaming as an example. Typical data analytics require a lot of slicing on one measure, say profit. Not only that analysts want to slice against common ""dimensions"" such as date/platform/geo, they also want to slice against a lot of other measures such as balance/player behavior/etc.

Now that with the benefit of columnar database, I really don't see the benefit of Kimball here. Analysts don't care how the data is layered out, what they care is to dump the data into a reporting tool or a mathematics model, and the least thing they want is to take care of the joins themselves. With Kimball, they are going to need at least 5-10 joins just for one analysis, because Kimball breaks everything apart.

My proposal is simple. You don't care about business meaning of your data, because frankly business owners NEVER use database, it's the business ANALYSTS who use database. The ""business meaning"" is in fact the final requirement that business analysts ask for. What do they ask for? They want a measure and a bunch of slicers, so why not give them that?

I forgot whether Kimball mentioned that Data modeler should work closely with developers (that give them raw data), but from top of my head I think he emphasizes more about working closer to the clients. I think working with developers is at least of equal importance because you want to make sure that the raw data is of the form you can transform easily.

So here is my method:

Step 1: BI developer (data modeller) meet with analysts to discuss requirement. At the end of the meeting they need to have a table with all fields needed mapped out. And in fact this table is the end product, not just a helper on the road.

Step 2: You meet with upstream developers and make sure they can give you these data. It is not necessarily that they give you the data in one piece, because developers also have frameworks and guidelines to follow, and giving you the data in one piece may damage those guidelines. But you need to make sure that they give you some linking fields to connect the dots.

Step 3: You import each piece to a different raw table with minimum transformation.

Step 4: You transform the raw tables into one single wide table that match exactly the one you got in Step 1. Profit.

OK one major caveat of this method is: If the analysts suddenly change requirements, then you have to expose the raw tables to them, which is uglier than what Kimball will expose. However I'd argue that for analysts, they should be able to figure the business information out from the raw table. After all they are not business owners. Business owners only know business, but analysts need to know how to slice/segment business, and even the raw data should more or less give them that.

In conclusion, I really don't see how Kimball offers any additional value here. If you break up your data to dim/fact tables, the analysts STILL WANT the wide table, but in the case of Kimball, they have to build it up by themselves, or you have to write a view for them. So essentially you add an additional unnecessary layer into the picture, and waste a ton of time building up a nicely looking palace.",14

Since raw data nearly always needs some measure of transformation to be useful, choosing a modeling design pattern (like star schemas) can help guide the process. As the data modeler, you're free to extend or hybridize the pattern, but it's nice to have a starting point.",17
225,"is-kimball-dimensional-modeling-still-relevant-in-a-modern-data-warehouse","I have been designing and building dimensional data warehouses (DWs) for a few years now and I believe this methodology gives us simple rules for 'judicious denormalization' which creates business friendly tables.

I agree with Josh's points here. I just want to add that the idea of joining fact tables together makes my skin crawl, if they're truly the same grain, then widen your table, if not, then you're risking gaps and duplicates that analysts will be annoyed by (and payback is a coming). For similar reasons I'm not a fan of ODS (Inmon) DWs, those subject area specific tables are great until they need to be expanded, combined and compared (and inevitably, the grain changes).

I would like to comment on Linstedt's Data Vault 2.0 (DV), it was very popular about 5-10 years ago (least in Australia), it seemed like everyone was decommissioning their Kimball DWs for DV. At the time, it made sense, DWs and SANs were slow, poorly designed and their DBAs stubborn (or cash poor). Overnight fact/dim loads were running well into the morning if not the afternoon. DV's methodology of parallel loading hubs and spokes from multiple sources seemed like the obvious next evolution. I worked on 2 sites that implemented DV and they were both a mess (technically and culturally). User queries or building cubes from DV tables was difficult, leading to analysts and BI devs were building ETLs on ETLs; data governance and linage suffered immeasurably. Not sure how it all turned out on those sites (I didn't stick around), needless to say, cloud computing meant the Kimball DW load issues dissipated, and hopefully so did DV.",18
234,"questions-thoughts-on-staging-versus-analytics-areas-in-warehouse","Hello All -

Question how everyone handles their schema management for staging data versus transformations done on staging data.

It's a good rule of thumb to not let users access the staging data, because as you build a warehouse you often need to constantly change how the staging and transformation process works, and if users write analytics/reports directly against the staging data the analytics will end up breaking as you change the staging and loading processes. And if users can somehow find and access data they will write reports against it one way or another.

To enable this, in a ""traditional"" DW, I am accustomed to having a separate schema or even database for the staging data versus the end-user accessible transformed data area and using the schema as a global way to ensure that the groups/roles to which end-users are assigning are blocked from the staging area. 

We are trying to figure out how to handle this with dbt. With our current warehouse project in Snowflake, we have a ""staging"" schema and an ""analytics"" schema. We have multiple analysts editing and working on dbt code and data transformations. We also want to keep all of the dbt transformations in one dbt project to have one DAG that makes understanding the data workflow simpler for all concerned rather than splitting ""staging"" processing into one dbt project and ""analytics"" processing into another.

The problem that we are encountering is that in order to allow analysts to be working on different code branches and data transformation flows independently, we want to use dbt's capabilities to allow them to just rename the schema and dbt should automatically create their own independent schemas. However, this doesn't work so well with the staging schema because we only want to maintain one copy of that, and some of the dbt tasks involve creating additional worktables and views in the staging schema. We also have some parts of the process that go staging -> analytics -> staging -> analytics because of the complexity of some transformations.

How do others handle this? Do you just put everything in one schema and try to be careful at a granular level about granting end-users access to only particular tables/views? Does everybody get their own copy of two schemas? Or are we just over-complicating all of this?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts!",1
234,"questions-thoughts-on-staging-versus-analytics-areas-in-warehouse","Hey @josh! Good question!

Can you elaborate on the difference between ""staging"" and ""analytics"" schemas for your team? In particular, you mentioned:

>  However, this doesn’t work so well with the staging schema because we only want to maintain one copy of that

In general, the dbt workflow supports each analyst having their own copies of all of the models in the project. If each analysts shares a single staging schema, I can imagine things getting pretty hairy pretty quickly!

If you haven't already, check out the docs on [custom schemas](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-custom-schemas). By default, these will add a suffix to your ""base"" schema name. That will let you create schemas in development like:
```
- dbt_josh
- dbt_josh_staging
```

dbt will handle the materialization logic for your models, so you can definitely have models that weave between staging and ""analytics"" tables. 

With custom schemas, you can override the schema name logic on an environment-specific basis. This functionality lets you eg. create all of your models in `dbt_josh` in dev, but split out the schemas into `analytics` and `analytics_staging` in prod. Check out the docs on doing that [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-custom-schemas#section-altering-schema-override-behavior-advanced-) and let me know if you have any questions!",2
234,"questions-thoughts-on-staging-versus-analytics-areas-in-warehouse","Hi @drew thanks for the response!

Sounds like you are suggesting each analyst having their own separate staging schema as well. In our scenario this means that dbt would need to be creating and building two schemas per analyst, not just one, as we need dbt to be able to create and modify many of the objects in the staging schema as well as the analytics schema.

We tried this a bit early on but seemed to get a lot of errors and had difficulty with doing it. If we collapse everything into one schema, then we run into the issue of greater risk of end-users seeing data that they should not. 

How do you suggest handling scenarios where the analysts are doing a bunch of staging transformations, involving both source data and intermediate steps (whether views or actual, materialized tables), but where the end results of the transformations should be a queryable, cleaned up model of data for usage by another separate set of end-users who should not be able to see the intermediate steps?",3
234,"questions-thoughts-on-staging-versus-analytics-areas-in-warehouse","So, this isn't a super unusual or uncommon use case -- this is exactly why we build custom schemas! I'd do exactly the thing you're describing: materialize your production models into the standard prod schema (eg. `analytics`), and materialize all of your intermediate transformations into some scratch schema (like `analytics_staging` or similar).

You can permission the schemas differently s.t. only analysts have access to the staging schema, but all relevant users have access to the production schema. 

So, I'd totally recommend just using custom schemas here!  You mentioned:

> ""If I write a query using CTEs, would you recommend having the CTEs as a separate sql files as `ephemeral` and then reference those or keep the CTE with a with statement in the same file? the compile result will be the same - but what are the pros / cons of the two approaches?""

**Pros of splitting CTEs into separate models:**
* Your CTE becomes a separate model, which you can then test (including ephemeral models!). This is often useful for testing uniqueness.
* If your models are materialized as tables or views, you can more easily debug since you can select directly from them in your SQL client.
* You can reuse logic in multiple downstream models (in which case it may be a good idea to materialize your model as a table)

**Cons of splitting CTEs into separate models:**
* More files!
* If your models are materialized as tables or views, you'll also have more relations in your data warehouse, which can make your warehouse seem cluttered.

**My recommendation:**
Like a lot of things in programming, it's about finding a balance! And normally I find that balance by going too far in one direction (e.g. no CTEs as separate models), and then overcorrecting in the other (e.g. _all_ CTEs as separate models), and then continuing to correct until I find a happy medium.

My rules of thumb are:
* If your model has multiple CTEs (and hundreds of lines of code) it may be worth breaking it into separate models
* If you are _aggregating_ in a CTE, split it into a separate model. For example, in this query, the `customer_orders` CTE aggregates, and I would normally split this into a separate model.
```
with customers as (
    select * from {{ ref('stg_customers') }}
),

orders as (
    select * from {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
),

-- I'd pull the customer_orders cte into a separate model
customer_orders as (
    select
       customer_id,

        -- aggregates
        min(order_date) as first_order,
        max(order_date) as most_recent_order,
        sum(amount) as lifetime_value,
        count(*) as number_of_orders
    from orders
    group by 1
),

final as (
    select
        *
    from customers
    left join customer_orders using (customer_id)
)

select * from final
```
* If it's a CTE that will not get re-used, it may be a good idea to keep it in the same model.
* Use the ephemeral materialization for lightweight transformations, e.g. renaming/casting to the right data type.
* If you are concerned about the number of relations that then get materialized in your warehouse, consider using [custom schemas](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-custom-schemas) to put them in a separate ""staging"" schema.
* Use subdirectories within your `models/` directory to group together intermediate models to reduce the clutter within your dbt project. This also makes it easier to configure custom schemas from you `dbt_project.yml` file. For example a nested structure might look like:
```
models/

303,"on-the-limits-of-incrementality","I've been doing a lot of work recently on projects that have large data volumes (1TB++), and this has caused me to think a lot harder about incremental models than I ever have had to previously. I wanted to catalog some of this knowledge for others, and would love to learn if others have developed approaches that I have not. 

## The Big Easy
The easiest use case to create an incremental model is when your underlying data comes in as an immutable event stream and your transformation on top of it does not require any windowing and does not have any late-arriving facts. Imagine an `events` table that you want to aggregate into a table `daily_user_events` that has one record per user per day. This is a simple group by with a `count(*)`.

In this case, you simply select new events that are greater than or equal to the max day already in the table. Here's what the code looks like:

```
with events as (
  select * from {{ref('events')}}
  {% if is_incremental() %}
    where event_timestamp >= (select max(event_timestamp)::date from {{this}})
  {% endif %}
)
--rest of model...
```
This will grab new events and transform them. Assuming you set your underlying table up correctly using a sort key or equivalent on your warehouse of choice, this will be _very_ fast. I have in practice seen models using this strategy take 20 seconds to process where a full refresh takes 1500 seconds, for a performance improvement of 98%+. YMMV, obviously, but my point is that this incrementality scenario is the best possible case if your underlying data and required transformation supports it.

## Late-Arriving Facts
Extend the above scenario to _late-arriving facts_—records that arrive in our source data table out of order. This is a common occurrence with event data, especially when that event data is collected on a mobile device. When mobile devices cannot connect to the internet they typically save events that they can't send in a queue, and then batch send them all later when they reconnect. 

This scenario causes problems for our above approach, because the `event_timestamp` will be in the past and therefore we will never pick these records up to be transformed. There are two ways to deal with this: _close enough & performant_ or _always correct & slow_.

### Close Enough & Performant
```
with events as (
  select * from {{ref('events')}}
  {% if is_incremental() %}
    where event_timestamp >= (
      select dateadd(day, -3, max(event_timestamp)::date) from {{this}}
      )
  {% endif %}
)
--rest of model...
```
This approach establishes a ""window"" of recent data to always re-transform every time the model runs. In the code above, that window is three days. Essentially, late-arriving facts have three days to arrive, after which point they are no longer eligible to be incorporated into our metrics (until, at least, we do a full-refresh).

This strategy is just what it seems: _close enough_. If you require perfect accuracy on every transformation, this isn't a good strategy. But in many cases the performance-for-accuracy tradeoff makes sense given that we're often talking about behavioral data that needs to be directionally correct, not 100% correct.

This strategy performs _almost_ as well as the base case. It's still an extremely limited table scan because of the `where` condition built on top of the sort key (or equivalent). If you can get away with this in your scenario, I highly recommend it.

### Always Correct & Slow
```
with events as (
  select * from {{ref('events')}}
  {% if is_incremental() %}
    where session_id in (
      select session_id from {{ref('table'}}
      where event_timestamp >= 
        (select dateadd(day, -3, max(event_timestamp)::date) from {{this}})
      )
  {% endif %}
)
--rest of model...
```

Using this approach we're grabbing _all_ events associated with a given session if we've seen _any_ events associated with that session since our most recent run. This will produce a completely accurate result every time the transformation is run because there's no possibility of ""missing"" any events: if any event associated with a session arrives late—even if it's a year late!—all of the events from that session will be selected and re-transformed. 

However, it's _much_ slower. The innermost subquery is still quite fast, and pulling all `session_id`s is quite fast, but grabbing all events from `{{ref('events')}}` that have a particular `session_id` is very slow because it's not using a sort key, and, really, cannot. Whereas the earlier approach could result in a 95% performance increase vs. a full-refresh, this approach is often (in my experience) closer to only a 50%. It's still better than doing a full-refresh, but it's not fast. Use this approach sparingly.

## Slowly-Changing Dimensions
If your transformation includes slowly changing dimensions, this will have meaningful implications for your incrementalization strategy. Here's the scenario. Imagine you have an table called `streams` that represents user's streaming songs on Spotify. And one of the fields on that table is `artist_name`. Well, from time-to-time, artists change their name (think Prince). When a name change for an artist happens, all prior streams look like they're associated with a completely different artist, unless you explicitly handle this in your modeling. There are two ways to handle this: _dimension tables_ and `custom incrementality logic`.

### Dimension tables
This is the best argument I've ever seen for creating star schemas instead of wide fact tables. If your fact table has an `artist_id` instead of an `artist_name` column, this entire problem goes away. You move some of the performance cost to analysis time because you're doing the fact >> dimension join at analysis time, but as long as the cardinality of your dimensions is less than a million rows you're generally going to be OK. On Redshift, make sure to set your dist style as `all` for the dimensions.

### Custom incrementality logic
```
with streams as (
  select * from {{ref('events')}}

  {% if is_incremental() %}

    where event_timestamp >= (select max(event_timestamp)::date from {{this}})

    or artist_name in (
      --subquery that gets distinct artist names 
      --that have been updated since last run
    )
  {% endif %}
)
--rest of model...
```
This approach has the same performance drawbacks as the _always correct & slow_ approach above: we're no longer exclusively using a sort key (or equivalent) to grab new records and so the table scan will take much longer. The only reason you would generally prefer this approach over building dimension tables is if the cardinality of your dimension tables is high enough that the analysis-time join would take untenably long. This happens in some rare cases, but it's typically rare.

## Final Thoughts
Incrementality is _hard_. It's easy to screw up, there are a surprising number of situations that arise requiring different design decisions, and it's fairly hard to test. I'm hopeful that this download gives you a bit of a head start (or a sanity check) as you're thinking through these issues on your own. 

Also: I freely admit that _I am not an expert on this topic_—there are real data engineers out there who manage many-TB datasets who have far more experience than I do. As a result I'm sure that there's plenty that I'm missing in this discussion. One of the patterns that I realize is common in the Airflow / Hive world that is not idiomatic to dbt is building tables explicitly partition-by-partition and running jobs explicitly for a given day. I do not fully understand if there are benefits to this approach that dbt does not take into account, or whether this approach is simply an artifact of those particular technologies and not necessarily desirable. 

Would love any and all thoughts. Thanks for sticking with me :)",1
303,"on-the-limits-of-incrementality","Couple of thoughts to add to this great post!

Even the Big Easy can get Pretty Hairy if you're combining multiple staged models into a fact table where each staged model could be quite large and potentially benefit from incrementality.
For example, your fact represents shipped orders (fct_shipments) based on a staged or base model of shipment data and you'd like to include several fields from a separate staged or base model for orders.
Your first instinct might be to select from both staged model incrementally. 
However, this will quickly lead to out of sync fact tables if you're not careful.

Let's say orders can ship 1 or more, or several days, after the order has been placed. Let's further say that to keep things simple and performant, we want build incremental logic based on dates (to support partition pruning etc) and not orders ids.
So, you might start with something like this:
```
{{
    config(
        materialized = 'incremental',
        unique_key = 'ship_date'
    )
}}
with shipments as (
  select * from {{ ref('shipments') }}
  {% if is_incremental() %}
    where ship_date >= (
      select dateadd(day, -3, current_date)
      )
  {% endif %}
),
orders as (
  select * from {{ ref('orders') }}
  {% if is_incremental() %}
    where order_date >= (
      select dateadd(day, -3, current_date)
      )
  {% endif %}
),
shipped_orders as (
-- inner join the two models
...
)
```
In this case, you'd **only** be selecting orders that were placed _**and**_ shipped in the last 3 days.
Also, because we're going to be deleting target data based on ship date, we'd be wiping out all shipments for a particular ship date, only to be replacing it with potentially partial shipment data for that date.

So, depending on your business model, you may have to either make window for your incremental date logic much _wider_, or forgo that part altogether and get all orders regardless of date, and then hope the inner join to shipments for the last 3 days will get you some benefits from the query optimizer. 

Hope that made sense...!",2
303,"on-the-limits-of-incrementality","Thank you @tristan, it's a great post!

There's something I don't quite follow. I've implemented *Close Enough & Performant* in the past but I had to delete rows that are being re-transformed. Getting that code to work in DBT is definitely not pretty.

In the example you're showing here, can you clarify how do you effectively overwrite rows without having to scan the whole destination table?",3
303,"on-the-limits-of-incrementality","This is a *great* question. I can tell you what I know. Curious to hear your thoughts.

dbt handles the deletion for you automatically, and it does it using query that scans on the unique ID that you specify in your model config. That requires a scan on the ID field, you're absolutely right. In practice, this ends up working quite well on Redshift and Snowflake--it performs well in most cases. On Bigquery we've seen this scan end up costing a lot--for some reason it seems to trigger a scan of the entire destination table rather than just the single ID column. I don't totally understand why that ends up being.

I wouldn't recommend writing custom logic to implement this functionality in dbt--if you're attempting to write hooks or something similar that do this stuff for you you're really going to be fighting the framework instead of working with it. If you want dbt to handle the delete part of the materialization differently, you should override the materialization in your local project and change the implementation.",4
303,"on-the-limits-of-incrementality","@tristan -- Great post, thank you.

One additional thing that I would like to see further discussed here. You mentioned that incrementality is good except in cases that involve windowing. However, a classic case involving windowing is the need to deduplicate incoming data. I'll usually write a window function to do this, partitioning over the common fields in the incoming data that would have the same values.

When calling APIs or getting any sort of event stream data, normally an ETL architect has two choices. 

1. At-least once: If there is any problem with an API call, batch, workflow, or anything along the way, the given data or set of data will be reprocessed and in some cases may be re-sent to the target (which is likely your raw/staging area in the database which dbt will then consult as Sources.) Meaning that incoming data may be duplicated on import but this is an acceptable price to pay for ensuring that incoming data is for _sure_ (for some practical and limited definition of _sure_) going to arrive even if there is a problem along the way. Usually used in distributed systems where having fully reliable and incoming data is more of a priority than performance and overhead of extra validation and deduplication of data at the target.
2. At-most once: Meaning that incoming data may be dropped along the way if there is a problem somewhere. Hopefully in practice this happens rarely but still possible. Usually used in systems where directional accuracy is more important than 100% reliability and the team wants to avoid the extra complexity, delay, and performance overhead involved in issue detection and deduplication.

More info on at-least-once versus at-most once here: https://bravenewgeek.com/you-cannot-have-exactly-once-delivery/

In practice, I have almost always used ""at-least-once"" semantics. Getting users to agree to ""at-most-once"" is hard because their very logical question in response will be ""Tell me how much data I am going to lose and when?"" to which there is no great response. You can't know that until you actually get all of the data, validate it, and thoroughly verify against the source where the data is coming from, and by the time you have done that you have probably already built an at-least-once system.

So, if we are often building systems that are at-least-once, and therefore requiring incoming data to be deduplicated, and the easiest way to do this is windowing, doesn't that mean that **in most cases this whole discussion about performant incrementality is moot because we have to do windowing?**

If others are mostly building at-most-once systems where windowing and/or deduplication is not required then I would be interested to hear about it. My experience is generally ""at-least-once"" and requiring windowing.",5

I've always thought that partitioning should be a feature of `dbt`.  The nice thing about it is that you can compose models that are idempotent, which is preferable to an incremental strategy imho (for reasons explained below). 

We use the following pattern with a lot of models at my job (it's the main reason why I put some time into adding the `alias` feature). It directly violates the `dbt` maxim of ""one model, one table"" but I'll try and explain how it addresses the issues you outline in your post.

### events_monthly.sql
```
-- set runtime variables
{% set year = var('year', run_started_at.strftime('%Y')) %}
{% set month = var('month', run_started_at.strftime('%m')) %}

{{
  config({
    'alias': '_tracking_' + year|string + '_' + month|string,
    'schema': 'events'
  })
}}

SELECT 
  * 
FROM events
WHERE
    date_part('month', ""time"") = {{ month }}
    AND date_part('year', ""time"") = {{ year }} 
```
### events.sql

```
{{
  config({
    'alias': 'tracking',
    'schema':'events',
    'materialized':'view'
  })
}}

-- set upstream dependency on monthly model
--  {{ ref('events_monthly') }}
{{ union_by_prefix('events', '_tracking_') }}

```

Here, we have two models: `events_monthly.sql` which builds a table for a discrete monthly partition and `events.sql`, which builds a view of all tables that match a common prefix. The heavy lifting is done by a macro, `union_by_prefix`, which queries the database to get a list of all tables with a common pattern (in this case, `_tracking_`) and `UNIONS` them together.

By default, the monthly model will build the current month's table, but you can also pass in `vars` at runtime to build a previous month's table. This is nice because you can address the challenge of ""Late-Arriving Facts"" by also regularly building models from previous months. This is an ""eventually consistent"" approach. Performance of the monthly models can be tuned by increasing / decreasing the size of the partitions (years, quarters, weeks, days, hours, minutes, etc). Previous partitions can be programmatically generated using this script I wrote: https://gist.github.com/abelsonlive/16611a745cace973a0c9a6f3b2b6000b

Downstream, other models only reference `events.sql` such that, to the analysts that consume these models, there's really only one `events` model. However, the challenge with this approach is isolating production and development environments. Ideally, an analyst shouldn't need to build all monthly partitions in order to work with the `events` model. For that reason, we hardcode the production schema in `events.sql`. This means that when you call `{{ ref('events') }}` it will only build a view of the monthly partitions in your development schema. Obviously, this is not ideal, but we've thoroughly explained this behavior to all `dbt` users, so they're aware of what's going on. 

How could we bring this strategy into the `dbt` paradigm without breaking some of its core tenets?",6
303,"on-the-limits-of-incrementality","Thanks for the quick reply @tristan.
As you guessed, instead of declaring a `unique_key` on the model, I used a prehook with a `DELETE` statement in order to get a ""truly"" incremental update where the table is not scanned.
Maybe this scan isn't as expensive as I thought (we're on Redshift), so I'll try removing that custom logic to see how well it does.
And writing a custom materialization strategy sounds a bit scary but I'll try to give it a shot next time I have to do something like this.",7

@abelsonlive Thanks for your detailed explanation here! I really like this a lot--it's really the first time I've gotten my head around the benefits here. Things I'm curious about:

- if you're locating all of this data into separate tables, how are you performing windowing across all of the tables? for instance, how would you create a `user_session_number` field?
- how does the optimizer treat the unioned view? does it understand how to only look at some of the underlying tables depending on the date range? assuming that all the underlying tables are partitioned appropriately, my guess is that the optimizer would be OK here but I'm curious what you've experienced.
- is the mechanism you're describing just the best way to do this thing on Redshift or do you think it might be the best way to do the thing you're describing across each warehouse?

I don't have any answers for you in terms of how to make this more dbt-idiomatic. I could imagine ways of achieving that, but honestly this is _currently_ more of a personal curiosity than a burning need from within the community. We just aren't hearing from a lot of people that this kind of functionality is a priority for them right now. If there are others out there for whom this is a big problem, I'd love to hear from you!

303,"on-the-limits-of-incrementality","I concur with @abelsonlive re partitions. 

This article lays out the benefits of this whole notion of partitions and idempotent pipelines: “Functional Data Engineering — a modern paradigm for batch data processing” by Maxime Beauchemin https://link.medium.com/q4dWH2pFdY",9
303,"on-the-limits-of-incrementality","My apologies on reviving an old topic, but I wanted to share my learnings about optimizing BigQuery incremental partitioned tables - specifically about @tristan's comment where BigQuery ends up costing a lot since it scans the entire destination table. For us, this resulted in incremental runs still being faster, but costing more than generating the table from scratch since we were billed not only for reading the incremental data, but re-reading the entire destination table.

While there's an idiomatic pattern to add predicate filters on the partitioned column of the tables you're reading from in dbt, there is no such way to do the same for the destination table you're merging into. When dbt writes the merge statement, it follows the typical pattern:

```
merge {target}
using {source}
on {target}.id = {source}.id
when not matched then update ...
when not matched then insert ...
```

The issue is BigQuery cannot perform partition pruning on the destination table since it needs to scan the entire table for matching ids. If for example you partition on `created_at`, and can guarantee that you only need to update matching data from the past 3 days, you can change the statement into this:

```
merge {target}
using {source}
on {target}.created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
  and {target}.id = {source}.id
when not matched then update ...
when not matched then insert ...
```

This will give you the runtime and cost savings you would expect. For us, this was the difference of a single table being billed at 34GB vs 600MB. As we applied this strategy to dozens of our incremental tables, the total cost savings were much more.

You can have dbt do this by patching your merge function in your project. Create a `merge.sql` file in your macros folder with the following contents:

```
{#
  Fork of common_get_merge_sql from the dbt source code that adds ""destination_predicate_filter"" config support.
  This optimizes billing for incremental tables so we can limit the upsert searching logic to a few recent partitions.
  This is the difference of doing a fully billed table scan of the destination table, vs only being billed for reading
  a few days of the destination table.
#}
{% macro bigquery__get_merge_sql(target, source, unique_key, dest_columns) %}
    {%- set dest_cols_csv =  get_quoted_csv(dest_columns | map(attribute=""name"")) -%}
    {%- set destination_predicate_filter = config.get('destination_predicate_filter') -%}

    merge into {{ target }} as DBT_INTERNAL_DEST
    using {{ source }} as DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE

    {% if unique_key %}
      on
        {% if destination_predicate_filter %} DBT_INTERNAL_DEST.{{destination_predicate_filter}} and {% endif %}
        DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE.{{ unique_key }} = DBT_INTERNAL_DEST.{{ unique_key }}
    {% else %}
        on FALSE
    {% endif %}

    {% if unique_key %}
    when matched then update set
        {% for column in dest_columns -%}
            {{ adapter.quote(column.name) }} = DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE.{{ adapter.quote(column.name) }}
            {%- if not loop.last %}, {%- endif %}
        {%- endfor %}

    when not matched then insert
        ({{ dest_cols_csv }})
    values
        ({{ dest_cols_csv }})

{%- endmacro %}
```

And then in your incremental models, you can update your config accordingly:
```
{{
  config(
    materialized = ""incremental"",
    partition_by = ""date(created_at)"",
    unique_key = ""id"",
    destination_predicate_filter = ""created_at >= timestamp_sub(current_timestamp(), interval 3 day)""
  )
}}

There's been some great back-and-forth from members of the community over the past several months on how to generalize this solution.

**In summary:** dbt will use BigQuery's new [scripting](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/scripting) feature to create a temp table of new records, grab all partition values from the temp table, and merge into the existing table _on those partitions only_. There's support for all partition column types (`date`, `timestamp`, and the new `integer` range), and we don't need to add any configs or hard-code the merge window.

We have snowflake and we load events using snowpipe and apart from maintaining  event_timestamp (time when the event occured) we also preserve “event_load_timestamp” ( time when the event was loaded into dw) and base our incremental models on event_load_timestamp instead.
So this covers for any late arriving events as well without putting any additional window as such.

Hope it makes sense.

Regarding Always Correct & Slow approach for the late arriving fact, I found it's contradictory between the above code and "" Using this approach we’re grabbing *all* events associated with a given session if we’ve seen *any* events associated with that session since our most recent run."" 
From my understanding, the above code says grabbing all session_id from previous 3 days from the max event_timestamp.",15

Sorry for reviving this old interesting thread.

Why relying on a business timestamp to manage incremental? 
If we are relying on an mechanical timestamp, like the loading timestamp , then even late arrival events will be taken and applied correctly during the incremental transformation.

315,"does-dbt-add-primary-foreign-key-constraints","Hi there,

I'm a newbie to this tool. With what i've read and tested so-far I was under the false impression of what the 'relationships' method of the testing feature does.

I've set relationships between tables and when I run the test command those tests are successful (i.e PASS). However, for those tables in the data warehouse i'm developing as of now, there are no PK/FK constraints - I have defined that in postgres myself or figured out where to define that within the models schema.

 - What does the dbt-tool actually check for in the case of 'relationships'?
 - Where would I define the PK/FK constraints within the model? Have not seen documentation about this, possibly missed that part.

Short snippet of the schema.yml:
version: 2

models:
  - name: customers
    description: A table containing all customers
    columns:
        - name: uid
          description: This is a unique identifier in the customer
          tests:
              # - unique
              - not_null
        - name: suppliers
          description: This is a unique identifier in the supplier table
          tests:
              - not_null
              - relationships:
                  to: ref('customers')

Thanks in advance!",1
315,"does-dbt-add-primary-foreign-key-constraints","Hey @oferk83, welcome!

dbt is typically used with analytical data warehouses like Redshift, Snowflake, and BigQuery. In these databases, column constraints are usually either unsupported or unenforced by the database. For this reason, dbt has the ability to assert data constraints without actually materializing them in the database.

When you run `dbt test`, dbt will generate SQL queries that assert the validity of the tests that you've defined for your models. You can check out the definition of the [relationships](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/dev/wilt-chamberlain/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/schema_tests/relationships.sql) schema test in the dbt repo. The `unique`, `not_null`, and other tests are all defined similarly.

With this paradigm, you can also test other attributes of your models that can't be expressed as column constraints in your database. Check out some examples of those in the [dbt-utils](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils#schema-tests) repo.",2
315,"does-dbt-add-primary-foreign-key-constraints","I'm not sure about BigQuery, but for both Snowflake and Redshift if you do define a constraint not only will it not be enforced by the database, but queries may return incorrect results if the underlying data violates the logical rule defined by the constraint.

So it can be risky defining constraints in the database if there is ever a possibility of the data being incorrect. Yes, you would catch it after the fact if a test was defined in dbt, but a business user might have run a query in the interim before you are able to remedy the data problem and gotten incorrect results.

So we have tended to shy away from defining constraints in Snowflake and Redshift when working with them. The risks outweighed the benefits for now, although if things somehow were to change we would revisit the question.",4
315,"does-dbt-add-primary-foreign-key-constraints","Thanks @josh - really good points! 

We don't have any plans to support adding column constraints natively in dbt, but some folks have made this work using post-hooks to add constraints. This might look like:

```
{{
  config(
    post_hook='create index if not exists ""{{ this.name }}__index_on_COL_NAME"" on {{ this }} (""COL_NAME"")'
  )
}}
```

We have a fledgling postgres package that implements these macros, which might be helpful here: https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/postgres

I haven't used these macros before, but might be a good starting point!",5
315,"does-dbt-add-primary-foreign-key-constraints","I didn't see anyone mention it here, but the main case for primary/foreign key constraints in data warehouses is data discoverability.

Two main use cases on the top of my mind:

1. Navigating related data and auto-completing SQL queries become a lot better, in DataGrip at least. These Database clients use the Primary Key and Foreign Key information to auto complete join conditions when writing SQL queries. When you query data, you can use the context menu to select data that match a foreign key column from a query result, for example.

2. Metabase automatically fills in Table metadata for you if foreign and primary keys information is available, it fills out metadata about the tables. If you have that information in place, when you use Metabase query builder, it's able to show to the end user the fields of the joined table so they can be filtered upon.

My thoughts:

Someone wanting to take advantage of that would have to use post hooks to successfully implement that. It's a little bit clunky, but works.

Since what I talked about is mostly about documenting the relationship between models, I think the sensible place for it to be would be in the YAML files, and then we should have an option some how to generate the ""alter table"" statements to make those happen.

@drew Question to you: do we have access to the data in the YAML files when executing post-hooks? I thinking it would be relatively easy to create a macro that you invoke from a post-hook to parse the list of columns and generate those exact ""alter table"" statements.",11
315,"does-dbt-add-primary-foreign-key-constraints","Hey @thalesmello - I really like the way you're thinking about this! I don't believe the yaml file contents are actively available in the hook context, but this is definitely a workflow I'd like to enable.

Presumably we'd want to do something like the following:
1. add a `primary_key` test which effectively just implements `unique` + `not_null`
2. provide some knowledge of the existing tests for a model in its compilation context
3. make it easy to distinguish between views/tables in these hooks: we definitely won't want to add these constraints on views!

Do you buy all of this?",12
315,"does-dbt-add-primary-foreign-key-constraints","I do agree with the things you pointed out.

325,"building-a-calendar-table-using-dbt","At GitLab, our data team loves dbt, not just for the power of the tool, but also for the power of the community. All too often, I find myself coming up with a hacky macro only to find that there's already a solution for that in dbt-utils, a dbt package with utility functions that can be used across dbt projects. As @tmurphy wrote in [4 Examples of the power of open source analytics](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/04/15/open-source-analytics/), ""the actual code that you use for analytics isn't your company's competitive advantage"". In fact, most of us are doing very similar analyses- the retention framework is the same, whether you're doing it in customer counts, dollar-weighted, or users in your SaaS product.

A couple of months ago, GitLab rolled out changes to our fiscal year, shifting from the traditional calendar year (January to December) to a new fiscal calendar which starts on February 1 and runs through January 31. As our [writing guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#writing-style-guidelines) outline, all references to quarters and years now *mean* fiscal quarter and fiscal year. All new metrics, not only going forward, but also historically, would need to be updated to fit our new fiscal model. This meant our existing date table, used for easily mapping dates to a myriad of values for analysis, was no longer going to be enough.

## Gathering Requirements

Before just replacing our table, I started by understanding what values the table *actually* needed to have. We used to have ISO dates that were never used. Rather than just try to replicate what existed, I started by understanding what columns we actually needed to have in the table. Which fiscal values and calendar values did we need to support? Where was the last iteration of this table being used in our existing dbt models that I needed to worry about breaking or, at least, updating? Empowered with my list of requirements, I was ready to get starting.

## Not reinventing the wheel

The most important part of a date table is the full series of dates that becomes the core of everything else. Rather than generate it myself, I relied on dbt util's [date spine macro](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils#date_spine-source), which I've used with great success before. I chose the starting date to be something well before our analysis began and ended it 40 years after today. We do use this table to do future analysis, but I thought 40 years from today would be further than our Finance team is doing any planning.

## Customizing for our use-case

Once the date spine was in place as the core of the analysis, customize the date table to our needs was easy, as I was comfortable with our business logic.  

Our fiscal year definition, for example, is:

>        CASE WHEN month_actual < 2
>             THEN year_actual
>             ELSE (year_actual+1) END AS fiscal_year,

March 2019 is FY2020, and January 2020 is FY2020. January keeps its calendar year as its fiscal year, but for every other month, the fiscal year is one more than the calendar year.

I tested this by picking out a number of dates and writing out what the appropriate value for each of those dates should be *before* comparing the results. They weren't perfect and it took a couple of tries to get it all right, but eventually we were there. We considered adding testing to the date table to be sure that we weren't missing anything, but after concluding that any custom data tests would just spot-check what I manually checked we decided not to.

## Documenting anyway

While this date model may appear to be self-documenting, we wanted to make it easier for our less technical users to understand what they were looking at and what column would hold which pieces of information. In our `schema.yml` file, we define what the column holds and an example of what the value would be for a given date.


If you've got anything other than a traditional calendar as your fiscal year, I hope this can inspire your approach to a date model.

328,"why-cant-i-use-dbt-seed-for-large-csv-files","Hi,

I have a few rather large but static files that I would like to upload using dbt seed.

More precisely, they are files of legacy data from systems not active anymore, and while it's well possible to host them elsewhere, or write a script to upload them, or any of a myriad of other options, dbt seed just... seems so perfect to use at first glance.

Well, dbt seed seems to be an easy and quick way to get the data where it needs to be, except that dbt seed doesn't seem to like large data files... It starts and says ""Running with dbt=0.13.0"" and nothing else happens*.

So... I suppose my question is why does it not work file files in excess of a few MB? (the largest file in question is 33MB in my case)

*I might add that
1) if I am having some patience, it loads eventually (and once it starts the first model, it loads quickly, too)
2) At least twice I had had some patience, but not enough, and CTRL+c'd... except that my action appeared to trigger the start of dbt seed uploading the data? Might have been coincidences, but the timing was spot on in both those cases...",1
328,"why-cant-i-use-dbt-seed-for-large-csv-files","What database platform are you using? In Snowflake we actually put these files in S3, point an external stage to them, and write code to create the stage for each dbt run and literally query the stage and import the records. Works in 10 or 20 seconds for 50 or 100k records. You do lose the ability to version the files in git directly integrated with dbt, but versioning csv files that are that large is a bit odd anyway.",2
328,"why-cant-i-use-dbt-seed-for-large-csv-files","Hey @Bijan! This is a really good question, and one that comes up frequently. Let me provide some background on the `dbt seed` command which I hope will help answer your question.

### Mapping models

In the early days of dbt, we created ""mapping"" models that were used in the data modeling process. These models looked like:

```sql
-- models/mapping/country_codes.sql

{{ config(materialized='table') }}

select 'DE' as country_code, 'Germany' as country union all
select 'FR' as country_code, 'France' as country union all
select 'BE' as country_code, 'Belgium' as country union all
....
```

In downstream models, we joined to this model in order to map a country code to a country name. Obviously this wasn't ideal, so we created `dbt seed` to help store (and version control) these mapping datasets in csv files instead of sql files. In order for this to work, we needed to make a general-purpose csv loader, but we definitely stopped short of building a full ETL tool.

The `dbt seed` command works by
1. Inferring the schema of your CSV file
2. Creating an empty table in the database
3. Loading data into this table using an `insert into ...` statement

This process works well for *mapping datasets* -- a few hundred rows with a couple of string columns is no problem! Things work less-well when you have complex datatypes (dates, booleans, mixed types, etc). Beyond data type issues, most analytical databases just aren't good at inserting data with `insert into...` statements.

Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift all recommend loading data from a blob filestore (like S3, GCS, etc). The problems that you're seeing are a direct result of things like table locks and query compilation, both of which can be avoided by using native database data loading functionality, or some ETL tool that is purpose-built for solving this type of problem.

### Should I load this csv with dbt seed?

In [the docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference#seed) we note:
>  `dbt seed`  loads data from csv files into your data warehouse. Because these csv files are located in your dbt repository, they are version controlled and code reviewable. Thus,  `dbt seed`  is appropriate for loading static data which changes infrequently.

I think the version control aspect is important here -- if you'd version control the file, then it's probably appropriate to use `dbt seed` to load it into your warehouse. If the dataset doesn't make sense to version control, then you're probably better off using some other tool!

If you're looking for a rule of thumb, I'd say a csv file that's up to ~1k lines long and less than a few kilobytes is probably a good candidate for use with the `dbt seed` command.

Mostly curious how teams are validating changes and testing, especially those that might be client-facing (white labeled, for instance). There is a sentiment that we shouldn't expect analysts and other parties who might be editing the reports to follow a traditional dev lifecycle (which I get to some degree), especially considering the fast iterations of reports that are possible with these tools.

It seems like this is a problem across various vendors, and editing a report on the fly has a wide range of potential down-stream effects (bad queries, bad visualizations, etc, etc). 

How are teams currently working to address this issue?",1
331,"best-practices-on-deploying-bi-reporting-tools","This is something we've thought a lot about and unfortunately no vendor that I know of currently supports the solution we want. (We here being the GitLab data team).

We're heavily biased towards a git-based workflow. My ideal world would have the entire BI tool based around git branches with a production branch being the main one that people consume. Ideally, any edits would happen on a branch specific to a user (or a named feature) branch and once an editor is happy with the changes they can submit for their branch to be merged back into production. This would trigger a review process from our team where we would check for all the things you'd want to check when reviewing a dashboard.

We're currently on Periscope and I believe something like this is on their roadmap. Mode has suggested they'd be looking at this sort of workflow as well. We used Looker previously and their git integration does allow for branching and merge requests to happen, but not for any of the actual dashboards. We felt this was pretty good though since as long as the explores were set up well then we would feel confident that folks wouldn't get bad results. 

Our current process now requires some education and training for people to submit issues to have their dashboard reviewed. (We have an issue template [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Periscope%20Dashboard%20Review.md).) It works well for us, but that's partially because we already have a strong culture of code review at GitLab.

331,"best-practices-on-deploying-bi-reporting-tools","The separation between dev and prod environments was actually one of the main reasons we switched from Mode to Looker. Allowing each analyst to work on their own branch and confirming things don't break prior to merging has helped us mitigate a lot of issues around broken reports. The current workflow looks something like:

1. Build and test dbt models locally
2. Change references to tables in Looker to point to your local schema
3. Run the Content Validator in Looker to ensure that everything still works. This is great for catching other reports that depend on the table you just changed.
4. Change references back to prod schema, and deploy to master

This workflow is still a little clunky, but it's worked pretty well for us so far. There are ways to programatically manage the schema reference switching between dev and prod, outlined in another discourse post [here](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/looker-user-attributes-and-if-dev-to-auto-switch-between-dev-prod-schemas/54), but that didn't work too great for us.

We also recently added a script that regularly validates all our user-facing content via the Looker API, and posts any errors in our #data-qa slack channel so we can quickly fix. Getting that in place has helped catch issues that slip through the cracks when deploying.

@JoeNaso – re: your original question:

First of all, I have been in this situation more times than I wish to admit. The first thing that I recommend is creating a culture that helps you debug ""broken"" or ""wrong"" dashboards quickly, to help you understand _what exactly has changed_!  We have [a guide on reporting bugs](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/corp/blob/master/Writing%20bug%20reports%20in%20analytics.md) as well as an [issue template](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-init/tree/master/starter-project/.github) that we share with any BI users that are reporting issues.

^That's obviously a reactive strategy, and long-term it's better to be proactive, so my $0.02AUD on this:

I think there's two types of changes that can impact a dashboard:
1. The data model that the dashboard selects from has changed
2. The dashboard structure has changed

These are pretty distinct problems, so I'll address them separately.

**1. The data model that the dashboard selects from has changed**
From a process perspective, here are some suggestions:
  * Implement a [PR template](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) that prompts dbt users to indicate if any existing models are changing – you can see our standard template [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-init/blob/master/starter-project/.github/pull_request_template.md#changes-to-existing-models). This small change can have big impacts.
  * Check the ""before and after"" of any major dashboards – no matter which BI tool we are using, we find a way to parameterize the schema we select from, so that we can easily do this.
  * Write some audit macros to validate changes! I have some macros that compare columns across two relations, and often use a version of the [equality](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils#equality-source) macro to do record-by-record validation. Pro-tip: write the audit query _before_ you make your changes; you'll thank yourself at the end :relieved:. Also check out [dbt-helper](https://github.com/mikekaminsky/dbt-helper)'s `compare` command – I'm pretty sure you can use this to detect model name changes, and it can probably be extended to also compare column changes (I'm sure @michael-kaminsky would accept a PR!). 
  * If your data model changes affect an end user, they should be involved in the PR process as a reviewer!
  * If your BI tool has a git integration, every dbt PR should have a complementary PR on the repo containing your BI code (or you could even have them both in the same repo! I haven't done this, but it's not a terrible idea!)
  


**2. The dashboard structure has changed**
i.e. the fields the dashboard selects, the visualizations it uses, or the filters it applies.

The answer to this one ultimately depends on the BI tool you're using, and I think the above responses do a really good job at covering this, so I won't repeat what they've said.

One point I'd like to make here is that sometimes dashboards change/mistakes creep in because the data model an analyst is querying isn't intuitive/well documented. Strong data model design, and good documentation can go a long way on this front, which of course, dbt helps a lot with.

A few extra points if you do use Looker:
* Looker offers LookML dashboards that are written in code, so can also be version controlled. I've seen some orgs have ""Source of Truth"" dashboards in LookML, and all non-Source of Truth dashboards as user-defined dashboards
* Alternatively, you can use Looker's permissions to ensure that only authorized users are allowed to edit a user-defined dashboard.
* I find that Looker can abstract away the git workflow too much – as an analyst whose first introduction to git was via Looker, I definitely learned bad git habits. I think it's worth spending the time to go through basic git workflows with your analysts (especially if you want to include them in the PR process, as outlined above), and (as you might expect) we've open sourced our git guide [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/corp/blob/master/git-guide.md).",4

We use Stitch for data loading. I thought about using a Google Form, and then pulling via [Stitch's hacky Google Sheets integration](https://www.stitchdata.com/blog/how-to-replicate-google-sheets-to-your-data-warehouse/), but I've tried that before and it didn't work very well.

360,"how-to-set-up-a-google-sheet-as-a-reliable-data-source","_This post is adapted from a more in-depth Medium article I wrote [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/google-sheet-data-warehouse-c22bb2cce4b0)._

I occasionally need to grant a non-technical colleague the ability to input information into our data warehouse on an ad-hoc basis. For example, our customer service team at [Milk Bar](https://milkbarstore.com/) maintains a list of special wedding cake orders in Google Sheets that we need to collect data from for downstream calculations.

This is a tricky problem: I'm not a web developer, and standing up and maintaining a web form or a database for something like this is overkill. I'm also not interested in paying for a separate product to do this for me. What if we could sync their Google Sheet directly to a table in our data warehouse?

I know what you're thinking. What about data governance? What’s to stop someone from accidentally deleting a column or entering data of the wrong type? How do I know that my colleagues are entering data according to my expectations?

In my experience, with the right guardrails and protections, Google Sheets can be a reliable and flexible component of your data stack. Here are my tips for setting one up properly as a data source.

## Securing your Google Sheet

### Permissions

Start by locking down your sheet so that it can only the right people can view and edit it. I like to check the Advanced option ""Prevent editors from changing access or adding new people"" to prevent inadvertent link sharing by my end users.

### Protected sheets and ranges

You can also lock down tabs or ranges within your sheets so that only you or authorized users can edit them. You can even set an option to warn users that editing a cell in a specific range may have consequences and they should proceed with caution.

You might have some sheets that contain necessary information for formulas or calculations that don’t need to be edited by any of your users. If that’s the case, protect these sheets and ranges so only you can modify them.

### Data validation

Data validation (accessed via Data > Data Validation) is the most important requirement for Google Sheets usage in the data stack. With data validation, you can set conditions on ranges within your sheet that must be fulfilled for data entry to be accepted. **Data validation is how you can essentially enforce schema control on a Google Sheet.**

For instance, let's say you have a currency column that must have a positive value. With data validation, Google Sheets will reject any negative numbers entered into the validated range.

There are a number of useful data validation criteria to choose from:

* ***List from a range.*** This criterion requires any entry in our cell range to match the value of a cell in a validation range. We often use it to force the user to choose from a list of predefined values or categories. As a handy bonus, you can add a drop-down list to each cell in your range so your user can pick a valid value directly. I like to keep a separate, fully protected sheet (only I can edit it) for my validation range.
* ***List of items.*** Similar to List from a range, except you provide the valid values directly as a comma-separated list. This is great for validating entries against a short list of static values.
* ***Number.*** This criterion is used to check that entries fall within a numeric range. We can prevent negative numbers or force entry to be less than a known maximum.
* ***Text.*** We can test entries to see if they contain or do not contain certain sub-strings. Perhaps you want to make sure your users are entering a proper prefix when they copy over invoice numbers. There are also a couple of useful options at the bottom of the drop-down: is valid email and is valid URL. These are both common validation needs that would require regex or something similarly complex to confirm.
* ***Date.*** We can validate that entries are valid dates and fall within a required range. Because of the multitude of date formats, dates are notoriously messy. This validation criterion is a vital if your users are entering dates anywhere in your sheet.
* ***Custom formula is.*** This is the real game-changer for data validation. You can write any custom formula that returns a True or False value and Google will validate entries against it. You can implement some really complex validation logic this way. For example, use the `REGEXPMATCH` formula to confirm that entries match a more complicated set of string logic. Google Sheets also doesn’t allow you to apply multiple validation criteria to the same cell, so this option allows us to combine criteria into a single formula.
* ***Checkbox.*** You can replace the cell(s) in your cell range with a checkbox that returns a custom value when it is checked and unchecked. True and False will probably account for 99% of the use cases here, but it’s nice to have the flexibility to represent something else if you want to.

Once you’ve thoroughly validated the data in your Google Sheet, your sheet will be just as good as a custom web form, if not better. You can be very confident in the quality of your data.

### Optional: Using an IMPORTRANGE intermediate sheet

Instead of syncing directly from the user-accessed sheet to the data warehouse, I like to set up an intermediate import sheet that only I can edit. This intermediate sheet provides me with a bit more control. I configure this sheet to copy all the data from the user-accessed sheet using the `IMPORTRANGE` [formula](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093340?hl=en). This sheet is where I can make any necessary adjustments before I pass it to my data warehouse.

* For example, I might only import a specific range of the user-accessed sheet, so errant data outside of that range doesn’t break anything downstream.
* I could also union two user-accessed sheets (maybe there are multiple sheets, one for each year) into a single sheet with a [vertical array](https://stackoverflow.com/q/31657470/3524951).
* I can even use the `QUERY` [formula](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093343?hl=en) to filter the rows in the user-accessed sheet to remove blanks.

### Alternative: Use a Google Form + Google Sheet instead

If users don’t need to edit data after they enter it, you can set up an append-only system using a Google Form. Google Forms has a native integration with Google Sheets, which makes this setup dead simple for append-only needs. Google Forms will append a row for each response to your form in a timestamped Google Sheet. If you add questions, the sheet will expand to match your form.

Ensure clean data by choosing the appropriate question types for your form.

## Syncing to the data warehouse

Loading a Google Sheet into a data warehouse is a common problem, so there are a lot of potential solutions.

If you’re a Google BigQuery user, the easiest approach, *by far* , is to set up the Google Sheet as an external table. BigQuery’s documentation [describes how to do this](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/external-data-drive) in more detail, but all you need to do is define a schema for the table and you can query the first tab of your sheet directly from BigQuery.

If you’re using Snowflake, Redshift, or another data warehouse, you can take your pick from these other options.

* Most ***data loading services*** have an integration that handles loading Google Sheets. See [Fivetran’s documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/files/google-sheets) and [Alooma’s](https://www.alooma.com/docs/connect-your-data/google-drive-and-sheets/google-sheets-integration).
* [***Stitch’s Google Sheets integration.***](https://www.stitchdata.com/blog/how-to-replicate-google-sheets-to-your-data-warehouse/) Data loading service Stitch has a guide on how to set up some Apps Script code in Google Sheets that will send data to Stitch’s Import API. Stitch will then load that data into your data warehouse of choice. With this approach, you have to sync the data manually by clicking “sync to Stitch,” which may be a blessing or a curse depending on your needs. Note that you will have to sign up with Stitch if you’re not already a customer, but syncing a few sheets isn’t likely to exceed their 5 million rows/month free tier.
* [***sheetload.***](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/tree/master/extract/sheetload) This is a Python tool created by the data team at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) to load local CSVs and Google Sheets into a data warehouse. At the time of writing, the tool supports Postgres and Snowflake.
* [***Ro’s Google Sheet integration.***](https://github.com/Ro-Data/Ro-Create-Table-From-Sheet) The data team at [Ro](https://ro.co) open-sourced their custom approach to loading Google Sheets data into Snowflake. Note that their approach truncates and replaces the data table on every load, so it won’t preserve deleted or modified rows.
* You could also look into rolling your own modular approach with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), webhooks, and a serverless function like AWS Lambda. You could trigger your Zap on row creation in your sheet which would send the data, via a webhook, to a serverless function set up to receive the payload as an endpoint. This approach becomes more challenging if you need to capture updates and deletions.

Of course, we can lock this down and use a new sheet, but then all of the reports would have to be updated.

Corporate currency was Euro, so that made sense. I suppose you can use them for any currency that is offered, but there is probably a similar source for other central banks/currencies. The ECB exposes its currency rates in an XML format* as well if you want to write the ETL yourself, but there is a python library somewhere that you can invoke to get them without hussle.

Thus, you have a daily rate. Of course you also need to have a logic that decides which date to use for any particular row of your data.

# Which exchange rate do you use? Day/month/quarter?
* It depends. If these reports are being used by your finance team, _ultimately it is up to the finance team_ to decide which exchange rate to use, and for the data team to implement it. That's because currency conversions have a real impact on their reports! For example, in Australia, it's regulation that accountants use the month-end currency exchange rate for financial reporting.
* If your finance team truly doesn't have strong opinions on this, my preference is to use a daily exchange rate.


# How do you model this?
## Source data
We generate a table of exchange rates in our data warehouse. Currently, it's a (sub-optimal) process of building a Google Sheet that uses the `googlefinance` function to grab exchange rates, and loading the Google Sheet into our warehouse.

Ideally, I'd like to use a Singer tap on Stitch for this, but there currently isn't a reliable tap to do this.

## Build a model of exchange rates
I would build a model with one record per currency, per day, with the fields:
  * date
  * source_currency: ISO currency code, e.g. AUD, GBP, USD
  * target_currency: ISO currency code, e.g. AUD, GBP, USD
  * rate: exchange rate to convert 1 unit of the source currency to the target currency

Any business logic on which exchange rate to use should be included in this model.


## Perform the conversion
I would convert prices at the lowest granularity possible (i.e. on the `orders` table, rather than a rollup of `daily_revenue`).
For each model with multiple currencies, I tend to store:
```txt
price_local
currency # the ISO code for the currency, e.g. AUD, GBP, USD
price_usd # or whatever the target exchange rate is
```
This is what the SQL would look like to convert to USD. Note that I've done it in a way that can be extended if you wish to convert to other currencies too.
```
with orders as (
    select * from {{ ref('orders') }}
),

exchange_rates as (
    select * from {{ ref('exchange_rates') }}
),

select
    orders.order_id,
    orders.price as price_local,
    orders.currency,
    orders.price * usd_exchange_rates.rate as price_usd
    
from orders

left join exchange_rates as usd_exchange_rates
    on usd_exchange_rates.target_currency = 'USD'
    and date_trunc('day', orders.ordered_at) = usd_exchange_rates.date
    and orders.currency = usd_exchange_rates.source_currency

```
Things to be mindful of:
* The timezone for conversion - it's up to your business to decide the logic here
* Accidentally using the inverse rate (I've done this more times than I care to admit)

# How do you handle currencies in your BI tool?
One thing to be really conscious of is that you want to **prevent your users from trying to aggregate the `price_local` field**. It makes _no sense_ to average an order of $20USD and another order of $15GBP!

To do this, I recommend ensuring that currency is added to any BI queries that reference the `price_local` field – on Looker it might look like adding `currency` as a [required field](https://docs.looker.com/reference/field-params/required_fields) to any of your measures that reference `price_local`.

On other BI tools where users can query the underlying data model without the guard rails of LookML, the only way to truly prevent this from happening is to remove the `price_local` field and instead create a column for each currency, filling the columns with NULL when the record is not in that currency, e.g.:
```sql
select
  case when currency = 'USD' then price_local as price_local_usd,
  case when currency = 'GBP' then price_local as price_local_gbp,
  case when currency = 'AUD' then price_local as price_local_aud,
  ...
```

^ This approach isn't very sustainable as your company grows though. 


Advanced things you can do in Looker:
* If converting to multiple target currencies, you can do some trickery with using [parameters](https://docs.looker.com/reference/field-params/parameter) that are added as an [always_filter](https://docs.looker.com/reference/explore-params/always_filter), so users can switch their reports between USD, GBP etc, without having to choose different measures. Kind of related is [this article](https://discourse.looker.com/t/using-looker-parameters-for-dynamic-timezones/9060) I wrote a while back on a similar pattern for timezone conversion.
* You can use custom formatting to get the right currency symbol for a price field, as described in [this article](https://discourse.looker.com/t/creating-a-formatted-money-value-with-a-dynamic-currency-symbol/1204)",6

364,"currency-conversions","@claire I am attempting to join similar data to your example, but there are cases where the system (Netsuite / Xignite) we are pulling rates from do not have a rate for every date. Is there a way to make that join grab the latest rate if the exchange rate doesn't exist for that specific date?",8
364,"currency-conversions","Hey @ryanonymous :wave:

There's two options here:

**:one: Create a `valid_to` column in your `exchange_rates` model, and then use an inequality join in `orders`.** 
To create the `valid_to` column, you need to check the _next_ record, which you can do by using the `lead` function. 
Depending on your SQL dialect, your exchange rate model might look like:
```sql
select
  source_currency,
  target_currency,
  rate,
  date as valid_from, 

  -- use a window function to find the next record
  lead(date) over (
    partition by source_currency, target_currency
    order by date
  ) as next_record,
  
  -- coalesce this with today's date so your most recent record has a valid_to date
  coalesce(
    next_record,
    current_date::date
  )
from exchange_rates
```

Then in your `orders` model, use something like:
```sql
select
   ...
from orders

left join exchange_rates as usd_exchange_rates
    on usd_exchange_rates.target_currency = 'USD'
    and orders.currency = usd_exchange_rates.source_currency
    -- order happens on or after valid_from
    and orders.ordered_at >= usd_exchange_rates.valid_from
    -- order happens before valid_to
    and orders.ordered_at < usd_exchange_rates.valid_to
```

402,"building-dbt-models-to-be-compatible-with-multiple-data-warehouses","## The best solution is no solution..
Even though this is not applicable to your use case, it needs to be said here (in case others are looking at this):
The best way to solve this problem is to avoid it! _Unless_ you are trying to maintain parity across both warehouses, **I strongly recommend using two separate dbt projects.**

Further, I don't recommend maintaining parity across two warehouses – ""source of truth"" becomes very messy quickly!

We sometimes see this need arise when someone is maintaining a legacy warehouse while transitioning to a new one. In this case, I'd also recommend _not_ trying to share models across two warehouses, and instead trying to move your dbt project over in one go!

But, since it can't be avoided in this case, it's worth sharing some wisdom we've collected when building for compatibility across multiple warehouses :) . This advice will also likely be useful for anyone trying to build [packages](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-packages)!

##  Challenges when modeling on different warehouses
You'll likely encounter the following challenges:
1. The SQL syntaxes vary slightly across warehouses
2. Your data may be loaded in a different structure
3. A performant model design varies across warehouses
4. Performance levers in dbt vary across warehouses

## 1.  The SQL syntaxes vary slightly across warehouses
### Why is this an issue?
Some of the non-ANSI functions vary across warehouses.
For example, on Redshift, to calculate the difference between two dates, you might do:
```
datediff('day', first_date, second_date)
```
But on BigQuery, you need to use a slightly different function, _and_ reverse the order of your args :exploding_head:
```
datetime_diff(second_date, first_date, 'day')
```
And on postgres this function doesn't exist at all. Bonkers!

### Using dbt-utils / adapter macros for cross-database SQL functions
Fortunately, you can use [macros](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/macros) to handle the logic of which SQL function you should use. Instead of writing the SQL, you can call a macro which returns the correct SQL for your warehouse, like this:
```
{{ datediff(""first_date"", ""second_date"", ""'day'"") }}
```
^ This assumes that you have a `datediff` macro that would return the correct SQL for your warehouse.

Even more fortunately, we've written a whole bunch of cross-database compatible macros in our [dbt-utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt_utils/latest/) package! (Just quietly, we think this is the best repository of knowledge around the syntactical differences between warehouses out there.)

You can leverage this work by [installing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) dbt-utils as a package, and then using the utils functions whenever you have SQL that needs to differ across your warehouses.

If there is a specific SQL function that we haven't written a macro for, we welcome PRs! Or you can also add your own macro to your project, following the `adapter_macro` pattern we use in `dbt-utils`.

One thing to note though is that there's a trade-off to be aware of here: using macros can reduce the readability of your models, and quoting strings correctly can be confusing (see above), so be mindful of using them too much.

## 2. Your data may be loaded in a different structure
### Why is this an issue?
If you use off-the-shelf products (Stitch, Fivetran) to load data into your warehouse, these services may load the data slightly differently. I have more experience with Stitch, so I'll speak to the differences they have across warehouses as an example:
* Stitch loads data into BQ in an ""append only"" fashion
* Stitch unpacks/flattens JSON objects on Redshift (since Redshift doesn't handle JSON well) but may not on other warehouses
* Timestamp types might differ across warehouses


### Using Jinja directly in your model
If a column name, or type, varies slightly across your two warehouses, I'd handle this with an `if` statement in your model:
```sql
select
{% if target.type == 'redshift' %}
    my_redshift_column as my_column,
{% elif target.type == 'bigquery' %}
    my_bq_column as my_column,
{% else %}
    {{ exceptions.raise_compiler_error(target.type ~"" not supported in this project"") }}
{% endif %}
    my_other_column

from my_table
```

On the Stitch front, @dylanbaker wrote some macros to handle the different way Stitch loads data in each warehouse, check them out [here](https://github.com/dbanalyticsco/facebook-ads/tree/master/macros/stitch). 

### Using separate models with different `enabled` options
If there is a huge structural difference between the data that gets loaded into each of your warehouses, it _may_ be worth splitting the SQL for the models into _two separate_ files.

A handy tip here is that you _can_ have two models with the same name, so long as only one of them is enabled. A pattern we’ve started using lately is to use a jinja variable to determine whether a model is enabled or not, as seen [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/facebook-ads/blob/master/models/router/fivetran/fb_ad_creatives.sql#L3).

You might create a directory of ""staging"" models for each warehouse (see [this article](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355) for more details on how we structure projects):
```
├── dbt_project.yml
└── models
    └── staging
        └── braintree
            ├── bigquery
            |   └── stg_braintree__customers.sql
            └── redshift
                └── stg_braintree__customers.sql

```
Then in each model define the following [1]:
```
{{
    config(
        enabled = target.type == 'redshift'
    )
}}
```
### Using adapter macros (not recommended)
Most of our packages use a pattern where each model calls a macro, and then the macro uses the `adapter` pattern to choose which SQL to use (for example, our [Snowplow](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/snowplow/tree/master/macros/adapters) package).

However, we've found that this _severely limits_ the readability of your code, so I'd advise against following this pattern. We are probably going to move away from it in future iterations of these packages!


## 3. A performant model design varies across warehouses
Credit to @josh for pointing this out.

### Why is this an issue?
Different warehouses favor different model designs – for example, BigQuery pushes in favor of denormalization, so you should leverage nested objects rather than joins. Redshift doesn't easily unnest objects, so they should be flattened first.

If you want to maintain parity between your two warehouses, you'll have to choose which warehouse you'll design for and make it the first class citizen, and then just squish your other warehouse to work with that data structure.

## 4. Performance levers in dbt vary across warehouses
### Why is this an issue?
The way to make models performant varies:
* Redshift uses sort and dist keys on tables
* BigQuery uses date partitioning
* Snowflake works the way you expect without any additional configuration

As such, the configs you supply to your dbt model will differ. For example, a Redshift model might have:
```
{{
    config(
        materialized='table',
        sort='created_at',
        dist='user_id',
    )
}}
```

Whereas a BigQuery model might have:
```
{{
    config(
        materialized='table',
        partition_by='date(created_at)',
        cluster_by='user_id'
    )
}}
```

### Supplying all the configs to shared models
Since dbt doesn't mind if you supply a `config` that it doesn't recognize, I would just add _all the things_  (i.e. performance configs):
```
{{
    config(
        materialized='table',
        sort='created_at',
        dist='user_id',
        partition_by='date(created_at)',
        cluster_by='user_id'
    )
}}
```

I prefer ""<>"" over ""!="" for not equals since the former is ANSI SQL-92 and latter is not. It is also very easy to type.

I ""group by numbers"" all the time. I find it very convenient and I have not heard a good reason (yet) as to why I should not do this. :)  I always follow ""Grouping columns should go first"" which I think makes this approach ok.

What is the reasoning for "" Commas should be at the the end of lines""? I think there are pros/cons for either approach on this one; I used to put commas at the beginning, but lately have been putting them at the end. 

For anything noted as ""bad"", it may be good to explain why. Some were obvious to me, some were not.

Thanks for sharing! Nice work.",2

Regarding <> vs !=, I didn't realize the former was a ANSI SQL-92 standard. TIL. I probably won't update change the guide it simply because I don't think it really matters one way or the other, and I just prefer <> is all.

I hear you on grouping by numbers too. I go back and forth on it, as the commit history of the guide would show for anyone who ever checks it out :). Might wind up going back to ""numbers are fine"" in time, we shall see.

Regarding commas at the beginning, it just looks bad to me. Obviously that's just a personal preference though. The main argument for having them at the beginning is that it makes diffs cleaner, but that's doesn't outweigh the ugliness of it IMO.

Copy on elaborating on the ""bad"" conventions when I have more than just a personal preference for it.

410,"sharing-my-sql-style-guide","In defense of leading commas:

in general, the most important columns come first. They're the ones least likely to change. The last column is generally much more likely to be modified than the first!

Do we care?

Well, if code is write-once read-many, then no. But if code is write-many read-many, then at a small aesthetic cost, it becomes possible to simplify git diffs. The vast majority of changes to a set of expressions will not affect the first column. 

So your diff when adding or removing a column at the end of a sql file will be exactly one line - it will reflect the action that actually occurred (a line was added, a line was removed) as opposed to two or more lines, which imply that a line was changed, when in reality a comma was added and then a line was added -- the real change was the new column, or the removed column. 

It's a small thing, but for me, keeping diffs as clean as possible trumps the aesthetic value of trailing commas.",5
410,"sharing-my-sql-style-guide","Great response. However, I would beg to differ and say the aesthetic value of trialing commas only applies to past-scenarios where Text Editors didn't offer a way to quickly resolve trailing commas. (e.g. VS Code and another editor offer multiline edits or some other macro/shortcut to make it easier for trailing commas to be edited).

But in regards to your aesthetic portion, I would say that trailing commas are great because they visually end the feature/column call, and logically proceed into the next call or line.

I don't know if anyone will find this _useful_, but I definitely found it _interesting_ so thought it worth writing up what I found!

## Postgres
We'll start here, because Postgres generally sets the standard for relational databases.

In Postgres 9, **users** and **groups** were replaced with **roles** (Postgres have been very kind, and have maintained `user` and `group` as aliases for `role` for backwards compatibility). The difference between users and roles? Simply put, users can now be considered as roles with the ability to login.

* Membership: Any role can be a member of another role, so you can create a hierarchical structure with as many tiers as you'd like.
* Ownership: Any role can own relations.
* Privileges: Any role can have privileges granted to it.
* Inheritance: Up to you! Roles can be configured such that any members automatically inherit the privileges of the role, or can be configured to force a member to explicitly change their role in order to use those privileges.

## Redshift
Redshift forked from Postgres somewhere around version 8. As such, roles look more like an old-school Postgres database rather than the role-based world of Postgres 9 – on Redshift, **users** and **groups** are separate entities.
* Membership: Only a user can be a member of groups, i.e. a group cannot be a member of other groups, so you can only have a two-tiered structure.
* Ownership: Users, rather than groups, own relations.
* Privileges: Both users *and* groups can have privileges granted to them.
* Inheritance: Users automatically inherit all privileges of any groups they are a member of.

## Snowflake
Snowflake looks almost like the Postgres 9 view of the world, but abstracts **users** into a separate entity from **roles**. Users are just the login credentials, while roles look more like Postgres 9 roles.

* Membership: Roles can be granted to users and to other roles, so you can create a hierarchical structure with as many tiers as you'd like.
* Ownership: Roles, rather than users, own objects.
* Privileges: Roles, rather than users, have privileges granted to them.
* Inheritance: Users have to explicitly change their role in order to inherit the privileges granted to that role. Each user can have a default role.


## Why does this matter?
This is good information to have if you're used to working with one data warehouse and are switching to another (maybe you're migrating warehouses, or maybe you're changing jobs!). It also has implications for the best practices when setting up users and/or groups and/or roles in your warehouse – we've got a whole article on this coming out :soon:, stay tuned!",1
445,"how-to-not-lose-your-mind-when-auditing-data","TL:DR; We've got a new package, [audit_helper](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/audit_helper/latest/) to help with data audits.

#  Auditing data: my least favorite task in analytics
As a data analyst, there's one task that used to instill more dread in me than any other – *auditing data* :weary:. This task generally pops up in one of two situations:
- I'm refactoring the SQL of an existing dbt model and want to make sure I haven't introduced a regression
- I'm creating dbt models that replace a data transformation that's happening somewhere outside of dbt (and sometimes not in SQL!), and need to show my stakeholder that my new model is a like-for-like replacement.

Sure, you get to feel a bit like a detective, but in reality, I felt this dread for two reasons:
1. The SQL involved in auditing data is often *harder* than the SQL for building models – writing a query to compare two relations record-by-record uses `intersect` and `except`, a query to compare relation structures requires querying `information_schema.columns` (unless you're using a Redshift [late binding view](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/validating-the-sql-in-a-redshift-late-binding-view/193), in which case you also need to  `select pg_get_late_binding_view_cols()` :man_facepalming:) .
2. And it's also *tedious*, bordering on frustrating – if your audit doesn't match up, it can be really hard to track down exactly why that is – finding the exact records that don't match can be difficult, and finding the SQL that has introduced the regression can be even more so! (Especially if you leave it to the end.)

But it's also a _really important_ skill. When I've opened up a PR that has a ""validation query"", it demonstrates to my reviewer (and to me!) that my work is rock solid, meaning we can get the work merged in more quickly. Here's a screenshot from a recent PR that I opened:
![53%20AM|690x239](upload://dEOFLeq63lNF3Y67ytdXaOl18YD.png) 
(I was also able to demonstrate _exactly why_ those 45 records didn't match.)

# Zen and the art of data auditing
I recently changed my workflow around data audits, borrowing one of the best practices from software engineering development – test driven development.

When refactoring an existing dbt model, rather than making all my changes, and then checking _at the end_ that my models matched up, I did the following:
1. Write an audit query (my test!) *first.*
2. Run a development version of your model without making any changes, and check that the dev and prod versions of your model match up (they should! You haven't made any changes yet!)
3. Refactor a small piece of the model.
4. Run the model.
5. Run the audit query.
6. If the query doesn't pass, debug. Once it passes, commit.
7. Repeat steps 3 through 6.

I felt Zen as I did this, I worked quickly, and I got the tricky part (writing the audit query) out of the way first! This tackled the ""tedious"" aspect of the problem, but that audit query was still more difficult than it needed to be!

# Introducing the `audit_helper` package
I've packaged up my most used audit queries into a new dbt package, [audit_helper](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/audit_helper/latest/) (new to dbt packages? Check the docs [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management)!).

There's two macros in here that are super useful:
- `compare_relations`: This macro generates SQL that can be used to do a row-by-row validation of two relations.
- `compare_queries`: This macro generates SQL that can be used to do a row-by-row validation of two _queries_ – sometimes when refactoring, I change a column name, or intentionally change the values in the column (e.g. coalescing NULLs with 0s). By comparing the results of two queries, I can take these changes into account!

Importantly, both of these macros are written in a way that means they can be reused across warehouses and projects, and the SQL in them is written in a way that helps you debug! 🧘‍♀️🕉

In the past, we've written lots of macros that are intended to become part of your project; whether they are used in models, custom schema tests, hooks, or operations, they end up living in the version controlled code. Here, we're writing a _new kind_ of macro; a macro that you should use while developing, but not past that. And the cool thing here is that we recently released a great interface for these class of macros – [dbt Develop](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-developer-ide).

Here's a quick demo of how you can use it in dbt Develop!
https://imgur.com/5USpaGL

In this video, you can see:
1. My project has the `audit_helper` package in the `packages.yml` file.
2. I used the `audit_helper.compare_relations` macro to generate a query to compare an existing table, with a model (yup! I could `ref`!).
```
{% set old_etl_relation=adapter.get_relation(
      database=target.database,
      schema=""old_etl_schema"",
      identifier=""stg_jaffle_shop__orders"" )%}

{% set dbt_relation=ref('stg_jaffle_shop__orders') %}

{{ audit_helper.compare_relations(
    a_relation=old_etl_relation,
    b_relation=dbt_relation,
    exclude_columns=[""loaded_at""],
    primary_key=""order_id""
) }} 
```
3. Two of my records didn't match perfectly:

| in_a  | in_b  | count | 
|-------|-------|-------| 
| true  | true  | 97    | 
| true  | false | 2     | 
| false | true  | 2     | 

4. Fortunately I could copy/paste/uncomment the compiled SQL to find those exact records that didn't match to help me debug!

| order_id | customer_id | order_date | status    | in_a  | in_b  | 
|----------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------|-------| 
| 44       | 66          | 2018-02-16 | completed | true  | false | 
| 44       | 66          | 2018-02-17 | completed | false | true  | 
| 56       | 79          | 2018-02-28 | returned  | true  | false | 
| 56       | 79          | 2018-02-28 | completed | false | true  | 



# Planned changes
This package is very much a `v0.0.1` – we intend to polish up the existing macros, and to add to it over time, creating macros that [compare the columns of two relations](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-audit-helper/pull/5), the relations within a schema, and more! If you've got an audit query that you find useful, PRs are very welcome :smiley:

2. Why are these tests important for you and your team?

- sources: mostly simply uniqueness, not_null schema tests
- staging models: occasionally to make sure transformations didn't create duplicates etc
- dim/fact models: this is where test the core of the business logic, e.g. relationship tests, expression, recency tests etc

We also have a series of custom tests that test conditions across models. 
For example, one project checks to make sure all orders contain at least one item from a certain product category. Another tests whether we've received a reasonable amount (above some threshold) of Fedex tracking data for our shipments (there is a time delay). 

In our largest project, we currently have 315 models to 191 tests, where all dim/fact models are covered by at least one test.",2
455,"how-to-get-started-with-data-testing","We use tests extensively and they have enabled us to dramatically improve the quality of our transformations.

For several years prior to using dbt, we did all of our transformations in (untested) Looker PDTs. Eventually, we started having problems as our engineering team grew and our product development velocity increased. Since we adopted dbt in 2018, we've used it to **validate our assumptions**. IMO Josh Temple's [Automated testing the modern data warehouse](https://medium.com/@josh.temple/automated-testing-in-the-modern-data-warehouse-d5a251a866af) is a must read.

I'd highly recommend testing to analysts that haven't gotten started yet. We got by without them for awhile, but in the end I wish we started sooner. Trust in analytics can be fickle and finding out about issues before your end users report them makes a big difference.

We use all of the built-in tests (uniqueness, not null, accepted values, and relationships), have created some macros for repeated patterns (unique_where, not_null_where, etc.) along with custom data tests for business logic.

Our project has 430 models and 2287 tests (admittedly this may be a little excessive, but it's easy to add/remove them).

To truly reap the benefit of tests and ensure data quality, some activities at the periphery of the tests are also required. I highly recommend:

* Monitoring the health of your data warehouse (i.e. disk usage) and that dbt is actually running on the schedule it's supposed to, within expected run-times, and alerting as necessary
* Routing test failures to a tracking tool (i.e. Rollbar) rather than Slack or email so you're not interrupted unless it's truly urgent. We're excited to use the new error levels functionality to further segment test failures here.
* Systematically addressing patterns of false positives (i.e. noisy tests) by pruning and updating tests
* Systematically addressing false negatives (i.e. data quality issues not caught by tests) through something analogous to postmortems",3
455,"how-to-get-started-with-data-testing","> What are some tests you currently run in dbt?

We run all the common dbt tests (unique, not null, relation, etc). Our most valuable ones though are our custom tests. These typically validate more complicated assumptions about our models. For some of these, they also store in code some aspect of an upstream business process. Our zuora tests (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/tree/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/tests/zuora) are our most fleshed out custom tests. We [have one](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/tests/zuora/zuora_account_has_crm_id.sql) that validates that every new subscription is linked to a Salesforce account. If this fails, it flags us to make and issue for the Finance team to fix it. We also validate the [lineage of subscriptions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/tests/zuora/zuora_assert_no_circular_linkages.sql) so that renewals can't be in the past. These are *very* valuable for data integrity purposes.

> Why are these tests important for you and your team?

It gives us confidence to move quicker. We trust that our data is correct _and_ we trust that we can make changes without breaking things because we have the proper checks in place. It removes some of the cognitive load on the analyst because they don't have to self-check all of these assumptions - they can look at a test and know ""Oh, every value in this column is unique"" and they can move forward with those assumptions instead of constantly second-guessing. 

> What advice do you have for an analyst who isn’t currently testing their data but wants to get started?

Don't think you have to do a big refactor to get going. Two is better than one and one is better than none. If you're using dbt (which, really, you should) then start with the basis of unique and not null tests. Keep adding as you're building. If you find a bug in your data, then write a test for it so you can catch it sooner. Start small and build the habit. Eventually you have a good number of tests and then you can invest even more in better coverage.

>  And, just because we’re curious, what’s your current ratio of tests to models?

226 models, 909 tests",4
455,"how-to-get-started-with-data-testing","While our use of dbt is still experimental and limited in use at HubSpot, we have instrumented testing/validation for our fact table/derived table pipeline. Each table is conceptually very similar to a dbt model (or combination of models). The pipeline generates 400+ tables and predominantly represents the work of data analysts across the company. The bulk of reporting and analytics queries initiated from our BI tool (Looker) are run off these tables. 

We currently use airflow to orchestrate daily script runs that generate/append data to the tables and this includes running test scripts against the data in the tables. After the tests run, any tests that don't pass are configured to alert users in slack so that the errors can be investigated ASAP.


**What are some tests you currently run in dbt?**

1. **primary key checks:** (since snowflake does not enforce pk constraints). This can help identify fanout that was inadvertently introduced by changes in the up stream source system, an up stream script, or a code change to the current script.

2. **acceptable value checks:** typically for data stored as a string, can be useful in cases where you are applying logic to a set of values you are expecting in a given column. If a value suddenly dissapears or a new one appears you will want to be alerted and update your logic to appropriately handle the new value. (ie: a column called program_name has expected values of silver, gold, platinum, diamond and then one day titanium appears -- wtf?!)

3. **data volume checks:** this type of tests monitors the volume of total rows or new rows inserted into your table and compares it against a defined baseline threshold. If the volume is higher or lower than usual it's valuable to be able to investigate and identify possible upstream ingestion issues. Unmonitored, these types of issues can be problematic because most reports will still run but the numbers could be inaccurate.

4. **value comparison checks:** compare the values in 2 fields to ensure they conform to expected results and make sense. A common use case where we run this type of test is to check for overlapping or out of order date ranges in scenarios where rows should be mutually exclusive, as well as logical (ie: start_date is not AFTER end_date)

**Why are these tests important for you and your team?**

Above all else, these tests are a critical tool for helping establish and maintain trust with business users who rely on this data. 

**They help analysts:** 
* stay ahead of bad data
 * uncover problems *BEFORE* they impact reporting consumed across the business
 * monitor for upstream changes that are largely outside their control
 * produce consistent and accurate reports
 * measure the quality and reliability of their work
 * communicate and elicit empathy from software engineers who control data in the source systems
 * be intentional about what they are building and how it should work

**What advice do you have for an analyst who isn’t currently testing their data but wants to get started?**

Don't hesitate to get started! Implementing testing will help create clarity and confidence in your data. 
* To avoid feeling overwhelmed, start with a focus on everything you build/update going forward, or your most heavily consumed data 
* If you know how to write a SQL query, you know how to write a validation test

 `SELECT 
     count(*) as row_count
     , count(distinct pkey) as pkey_count
     , sum(iff(field_name NOT IN ('VALUE 1', 'VALUE 2', 'VALUE 3','VALUE 4'),1,0)) as relationship_type_out_of_range
     , sum(iff(start_date > end_date,1,0)) start_end_date_check
             FROM schema.table_name
`
* At a very minimum you can start by checking your primary keys, and if you don't have those defined in the database that's okay, you should still know what 1 row of data represents for each table and can use a simple `row()` function to generate the key in the table

* If you can, I recommend storing the results of the tests in a table in the database so you can build some meta reporting on your data validity/pipeline health
 
* Adopt testing into your standard process and make it required to release new code

**And, just because we’re curious, what’s your current ratio of tests to models?**
	
Here's the moment of truth -- right now we have < 10% coverage (40+ tests) for our 400+ tables. Test scripts are currently NOT a requirement at HubSpot and we definitely feel that pain.


Testing really should be considered analogous to brushing your teeth. Would you ever think twice about brushing your teeth? It's a basic form of hygeine that produces a STANK when skipped. Avoid the decay & test your data!",5

The best approach is to configure this straight from your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```
models:
  materialized: ""{{ 'table' if target.name == 'prod' else 'view' }}""
```

If you need the output to be a boolean:
```
models:
  materialized: ""{{ 'table' if target.name == 'prod' else 'view' }}""
  my_project:
    for_export:
      enabled: ""{{ (target.name == 'prod') | as_bool }}""
```

Another approach is to set the materialization rule on a per-model level:
```
{{
    config(
        materialized=('table' if target.name == 'prod' else 'view')
    )
}}
```
However, if you are using Slim CI, this approach will lead to models running unnecessarily because the file's contents change between `prod` and `dev`. 

You could also conceivably create a [custom materialization](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/creating-new-materializations) that packages up this logic, but I'd recommend this as a last resort!",1

I trying to figure out how to best model that in dbt?  As you can see different columns get updated depending on the various (non unique key fields).  Is there a way to add this statement to dbt and get it to increment the model, or do I need to break it up into a set of selects, one for each ""WHEN MATCHED""  and ""WHEN NOT MATCHED"" statement?

Any help or docs explaining that would be useful or how have others solved this?

471,"handling-merge-statements-in-incremental-models","Hey @axdahl - we tend to avoid `merge` statements like this for the same reason that we avoid writing insert/update statements on other databases: this type of DDL mixes data modeling logic with table-building logic. To be sure, I think it's totally reasonable to run a query like this, I just want to give some insight into why this exact merge statement isn't directly representable in dbt.

It's a little tricky for me to wrap my head around the particular logic you're outlining here. I think you'll need to use an `incremental` model, possibly joining back to the destination table. 

I'd try to frame it like this: write the select statement which generates the records you want to upsert into your destination table. If it turns out that the field you want to upsert on is non-unique, you can set dbt's [incremental_strategy](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/snowflake-configs#section-merge-behavior-incremental-models-) to do a `delete+insert` instead of a `merge`.

Last thing: I'd recommend generating a surrogate key for the field that you're joining on (eg. `md5(col_a || col_b || col_c`) as it should make your join logic a whole lot cleaner here. More info on that [here](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/the-most-underutilized-function-in-sql-9279b536ed1a) and [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils#surrogate_key-source).

Here's a quick example that should hopefully get you started! Let me know how it goes :)

```sql
with source_data as (

	select
		'abc' as id,
		1 as col_d,
		2 as col_e,
		3 as col_f

),

destination_table as (

	-- use {{ this }} to select from the destination table
	-- wrap it in {% if is_incremental() %} to make it work
	--   in full-refresh builds

	select
		'abc' as id,
		10 as col_d,
		null::int as col_e,
		12 as col_f

)

select
	greatest(s.col_d, t.col_d) as col_d,
	coalesce(t.col_e, s.col_e) as col_e,
	coalesce(t.col_f, s.col_f) as col_f

# What _is_ an EAV model?
Let's just lift the description from Wikipedia:
> **Entity–attribute–value model**  ( **EAV** ) is a [data model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model) to encode, in a space-efficient manner, entities where the number of attributes (properties, parameters) that can be used to describe them is potentially vast, but the number that will actually apply to a given entity is relatively modest.

Let's take an example of a `products` model. In a relational model, you might have a `products` table like so:
### dbt_swag_shop.products
| id | name             | price | brand            | size | color  | width_mm | volume_ml | is_bpa_free | 
|----|------------------|-------|------------------|------|--------|----------|-----------|-------------| 
| 1  | dbtshirt         | 2     | Asos     | S    | Grey   | NULL     | NULL      | NULL        | 
| 2  | Logo Sticker     | 3     | StickerMule | NULL | Orange | 50       | NULL      | NULL        | 
| 3  | dbt water bottle | 1     | Purist           | NULL | Orange | NULL     | 650       | True        | 

We can see here that the relational model doesn't extend very well – each product has really different attributes, so this table would become really wide over time.

In an EAV model, this would instead be expressed through a series of tables like this:
### dbt_swag_shop.entities
| entity_id | entity_code | 
|-----------|-------------| 
| 1         | product     | 
| 2         | product     | 
| 3         | product     | 

## dbt_swag_shop.attributes

NB: The values are split into a table for each data type, since databases can't store a column that contains both strings and decimals.

The EAV approach offers flexibility, and makes it easy to get data in! A computer can easily read this data, but for us mere mortals, it's a little harder to instinctively understand, say, what the name of a product is.

These days, it's much more common to store these sparse attributes in a json dictionary (if you're using Snowflake or BigQuery, you'll have a pretty good time writing SQL against that data). The only benefits I can really see of the EAV model over a dictionary-based approach is that:
- if you want to change an attribute name (say `color` -> `colour`), you only have to update the name in one place
- data types are strongly forced in an EAV model

Given the choice, I'd prefer to work with attributes that are stored in a dictionary. However, as analytics engineers, often we can't choose the data structure that we have to work with. So if we have an EAV model, what's the best way to get it into a shape we can work with?

# SQL for flattening an EAV model
Let's say we want to build a table of products, with the attributes `name`, `price`, and `color` as columns. Here's the SQL:
```sql
with products as (
  select * from dbt_swag_shop.entities
  where entity_code = 'product'
),

name as (
  select * from dbt_swag_shop.values_string
  where attribute_id = 1
),

price as (
  select * from dbt_swag_shop.values_integer
  where attribute_id = 2
),

brand as (
  select * from dbt_swag_shop.values_string
  where attribute_id = 3
),

final as (
  select
    product.entity_id as product_id,
    name.value as name,
    price.value as price,
    brand.value as brand
  
  from products
  left join name using (entity_id)
  left join price using (entity_id)
  left join brand using (entity_id)
)

select * from final

```

Hold up! How did I know which `dbt_swag_shop.values_{{ data_type }}` table to query? And how did I know the `attribute_id`s to filter on? Well, I ran this query _before_ I wrote my SQL  :sweat_smile:
```sql
select * from dbt_swag_shop.values_string
where attribute_code in ('name', 'price', 'brand')
```

Which returns:
| attribute_id | attribute_code | data_type | 
|--------------|----------------|-----------| 
| 1            | name           | string    | 
| 2            | price          | integer   | 
| 3            | brand          | string    | 

Looking back at the main query, you can see that there's a lot of repetition a lot of repetition – those subqueries all follow a patten, as do the column names. Where there's a pattern, there's often an opportunity to turn it into a loop! And what we actually want to do is iterate over the results of that second query!

# Putting this together in dbt
In dbt, the [run_query](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/run_query) macro lets you run a query, and returns the results of that query to your jinja context! Perfect!

Here's the code I used to flatten out the EAV model given a list of columns I wanted to build:

```
{# These are the columns we will be creating #}
{% set attribute_codes=[
    'name',
    'price',
    'brand'
] %}

{#- This query gives us the information we need to be able to join the EAV model #}
{%- set product_attributes_query -%}
  select * from dbt_swag_shop.values_string
  where attribute_code in ('{{ attribute_codes | join (""', '"") }}')
{%- endset -%}

{#- Run this query, and load the results into the Jinja context -#}
{%- set product_attributes_results=run_query(product_attributes_query) -%}

{#- Light transformation to make the results easier to work with -#}
{%- if execute -%}
{%- set product_attributes=product_attributes_results.rows -%}
{%- else -%}
{%- set product_attributes=[] -%}
{%- endif -%}

{#- MODEL CODE -#}

with products as (
  select * from dbt_swag_shop.entities
  where entity_code = 'product'
),

{% for attribute in product_attributes %}

{{ attribute['attribute_code'] }} as (
    select * from dbt_swag_shop.value_{{ attribute['data_type']  }}
    where attribute_id = {{ attribute['attribute_id'] }}
),

{% endfor %}

final as (
    select
        product.entity_id as product_id,

    {% for attribute in product_attributes %}
        {{ attribute['attribute_code'] }}.value as {{ attribute['attribute_code' ] }} {{- "", "" if not loop.last }}
    {% endfor %}

    from products

    {% for attribute in product_attributes %}
    left join {{ attribute['attribute_code'] }} using (entity_id)
    {% endfor %}
)

select * from final
```
^ This code is pretty complex, but extremely flexible. If you want to add an extra column to your flattened model, you only need to add it to the `attribute_codes` list at the top of this code block.

But, I have traded readability for flexibility. If I were actually only creating three columns, I would likely use the first version of the query. Given I was actually using this to flatten a model with a dozen columns, which we want to add to later, it felt like it was worth it.

If you wanted to take it one step further, you could abstract this even more and package it up as a macro, so you can repeat this pattern to flatten all the entities (`products`, `stores`, `customers`, `brands`, etc.) in your EAV model by simply calling something like:
```
{{ flatten_eav_model(
  entity='product',
  columns=['name', 'price', 'brand']
) }}
```

508,"limiting-dev-runs-with-a-dynamic-date-range","Hey folks,

So far I've been limiting the date range on base model view files when doing dev runs as follows:

```
{% if target.name == 'dev' %}
where date(date) >= date_add(current_date(), interval -3 day)
{% endif %}

 ```

This works fine, but with many models it's not so **DRY**  what with all this repeated code across the base model files. Thus I'd like to make some form of 'dev_limit_date' macro.

To note:
- I would like to set the date interval (i.e. '- 3 days') in the macro, and not in the separate model files, because I may change this ad-hoc depending on what is being tested in dev. I only want to state it once.

- 'date(date)' is subject to change across model files, depending on the underlying source date field to be filtered. So I may need to set the date field to be filtered in the model file, i.e. with a `{% set filter_date = 'date' %}`

I've previously tested this in a number of ways (e.g. here: https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C0VLZPLAE/p1562678315423500?thread_ts=1562671748.420900&cid=C0VLZPLAE) but I cannot seem to get it running nicely.

Thanks for your suggestion -  thats for sure an interesting read and I've taken some points made in it into consideration. I'll continue the 'dev_limit' macro discussion here however.

What I'm now thinking is more of a macro that adds specified LIMIT where called in models, i.e. base for a limit on source tables. I've managed to successfully compose a macro that takes an argument that sets a specified LIMIT in terms of result row count (or takes a default limit) if target is dev - (I am checking in the target run file after running). But what I am struggling to do is add a disabling feature on this macro (that works) - i.e. via a second macro that can disable the first.

I'm setting the row count limit via the cli when running models in dev, i.e. as follows:

`dbt run --vars 'row_count: 100'` (sets a dev limit row count of 100, overwriting the default)
`dbt run`(runs with the default dev limit row count (i.e. here 10,000))
`dbt run --vars 'dev_disable: true'`(this would ideally disable the dev_limit_rows macro)

So, here are my files:

(model file) model.sql :
```
select *
from {{ source('data', 'source') }}
{{ dev_limit(row_count, dev_disable) }}
```
(macro) dev_limit_rows.sql : 
```
{% macro dev_limit_rows(row_count, dev_disable) -%}

{{ config(tags=[""dev_limit""]) }}

{# set row count limit on base tables for dev runs - '10000' is default value if not explicitly defined #}

{% if target.name == 'dev' %}

  limit {{ var(""row_count"", ""10000"") }}

{% endif %}

{%- endmacro %}
``` 
(macro) dev_limit.sql : 
```
{% macro dev_limit(row_count, dev_disable) -%}


  {%- if dev_disable -%}

    --no op

  {%- else -%}

    {{ dev_limit_rows(row_count, dev_disable) }}

  {%- endif -%}

{%- endmacro %}

The thing that jumps out at me here is your model SQL:

Should this instead be
```
select *

Maybe one approach is to push the limit/disable logic into the `dev_limit` macro, so:

**dev_limit.sql**
```
{% macro dev_limit() -%}
  {%- if var('dev_disable', default=false) -%}

510,"guide-notes-on-moving-from-postgres-to-snowflake","TL;DR - get ready for any SQL business logic to fail - in looker, DBT, etc. I highly recommend doing the migration over the weekend, give yourself a full day or two of work to fix up differences.

I spent this past weekend migrating from postgres to Snowflake. Tristan has already written a post on on redshift to snowflake, but I thought I’d briefly jot down my notes if you are considering a postgres->snowflake move
- schema search path: I set the default schema in my DBT pre-run-hook, no can do in snowflake, so I used regex to append schemas to all mentioned tables (I know, I know, use sources).
- typecasting pain: I did a lot of  `SUM(has_discounts) as n_discounts` , and am having difficulty casting booleans to a number
- datetime pain - I had variables like  `NOW() - MAX(table.created_at) AS time_since_update` , and this magically showed up in Looker as “5 hours, 26 minutes…“. Snowflake, I need to  `DATEDIFF`  and have to choose to look at minutes or hours or days.
- casing - snowflake has different casing preferences, that work very poorly with looker, which by default quotes all your column names. I removed all of the quotes in my LookML to fix this.


From Dan Hunt (DBT group)

I’ve also just done a Postgres -> Snowflake migration. The main points not mentioned that come to mind are related to Snowflake regular expressions:
-  **Regex matching:**  the Postgres shorthand  `column ~ 'regex'`  becomes  `rlike(column, 'regex')`
-  **Regex captures:**  extracting based on a regular expression capture changes from  `substring(column from 'regex')`  to  `regex_substring(column, 'regex', 1, 1, 'ie')`  to get the first match in a string (or similar, depending on case sensitivity, capture group, etc.)
-  **Regex escaping:**  in regex patterns, you need to double backslash to escape, so  `\.` becomes  `\\.` A few functions in Snowflake and  *not*  in Postgres have also been pretty helpful:
-  `ifnull(a, b)` : I prefer this function for readability to the Postgres equivalent,  `coalesce(a, b)`
-  `iif(condition, a, b)` : perhaps not everyone agrees here, but I prefer this to a  `case`  statement with only one condition for cleaner code.
- I haven’t used  `try_cast`  yet, but this is also missing an equivalent from Postgres and potentially a big one for cleaning up conversions near the source layer


From gitlab - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/issues/645

* `now()` was replaced with `current_date`
* UDFs had to be re-written
* date math is totally different; we can now leverage the native `datediff` and `dateadd` to see the difference between two dates or a date and some interval ( `dateadd` can also subtract by use of negative intervals)
* `stringagg` to `listagg`

> **Snapshots should almost always be run against source tables**. Your models should then select from these snapshots, using the `ref` function. As much as possible, snapshot your source data in its raw form and use downstream models to clean up the data.

So if you've already got some snapshots in your project, here are some patterns we find useful when writing models that are built on top of a snapshot: 

### `ref` your snapshot

Just like models and seeds, you can use the ref [function](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/ref) in place of a hardcoded reference to a table or view. It's a good idea to use `ref` in any models that are built on top of a snapshot so you can understand the dependencies in your DAG.

### Use `dbt_valid_to` to identify current versions
It might be useful for downstream models to only select the current version of a record -- use the `dbt_valid_to` column to identify these rows.
```
select
  ...,
  dbt_valid_to is null as is_current_version

from {{ ref('snapshot_orders') }}
```

### Add a version number for each record
Use a window function to make it easier for anyone querying this model to understand the versions for a given record. 
```
select
  ...,
  row_number() over (
    partition by order_id -- this is the unique_key of the source table
    order by dbt_valid_from
  ) as version

from {{ ref('snapshot_orders') }}
```


### Coalesce `dbt_valid_to` with a future date

Coalescing this field replaces NULLs with a date, making it easy to join to the snapshot in any downstream models (join conditions do not like NULLs). Danielle Dalton, from Rent the Runway, recently shared that RTR uses a [variable](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/var) in their dbt project, `the_distant_future`, to make their future date consistent across models, like so:
```
select
  ...,
  dbt_valid_from as valid_from,
  coalesce(
      dbt_valid_to,
      {{ var('the_distant_future') }}
  ) as valid_to

from {{ ref('snapshot_orders') }}
```
:point_up: I like that a lot. 

## Union your snapshot with pre-snapshot ""best guess""

It's often the case that you start snapshotting a data source after it has had historical changes. In this case, it might be worth writing a query to construct your ""best guess"" of the historic values, and union it together with your snapshot for a complete history. The team at RTR add a column, `historical_accuracy`, to let their end users know whether the record is inferred or actual.

## Date-spine your snapshot

Sometimes it makes more sense to have a record per day, rather than a record per changed record. We use a pattern we refer to as ""date spining"" to achieve this – in short we join snapshot to a table of all days to fan it out. We've written more about this pattern [in this article](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/finding-active-days-for-a-subscription-user-account-date-spining/265).

## Make your model resilient to the timing of the snapshot

Even if you plan to run a snapshot daily, the nature of ETL jobs is that they'll fail from time to time, resulting in missed days. Or, you may accidentally run a snapshot twice in a day. As a result, write the SQL in your model to be able to handle any missed days, or days with multiple snapshots.",1

I'm interested in disambiguating operational concerns from modeling. IE I want to use snapshots as sources for models without having to physically instantiate them as part of a dev workflow(for ex. i may not have schema create permissions in an env and namespace collision makes working within a single schema difficult). I was thinking of implementing a custom materialization based off of 'incremental' or maybe a riff on your 'increment_by_period'  ('incremental_snapshot'?) that just adds a 'where eff_end_dt is null' to the end of a model's select statement. Then have snapshot specific envs configured for that materialization while other envs can point at raw tables/seed data(that may not have dbt scd columns). Also have thought that maybe implementing a custom strategy on incremental might work. Do you have any thoughts on these approaches?",4

1. What happens when we learn that a field was incorrect, and we need to 'correct' history ?

1. How do you tackle this idea of pre-snapshot history? (@claire :  would love to see some ideas/examples on this -- i really like the idea of quality column)

532,"pivoting-and-incremental-materializations","Pivoting data is a very common task for reporting models in dbt. So much so that one of the [oldest and most useful utility macros][dbt-utils-pivot] is for pivoiting.  In my experience though, pivoting doesn't play very nice with one of one of dbt's most powerful features - incremental materializations.

If you are a heavy user of incremental models, then the following sql will look familiar to you:

```sql
select
    event_at as event_at,
    count(distinct user_id) as daily_active_users
from raw_app_data.events

{% if is_incremental() %}
  where event_at > (select max(event_at) from {{ this }})
{% endif %}

group by 1
```

This might be so common in your projects that you might have [abstracted away][pageup-dbt-utils-timestamp-incremental] the incremental logic with the help of [handy macros][pageup-dbt-utils-timestamp-columns].  And this simple approach will work for 80% of all the models you write. Pivots however fall into that other 20%.

Take for example this pivot model which is to show a list of responses for an application:

```sql
SELECT new_rows.*
FROM (
    SELECT form_attr.application_id AS application_id,
           {{ pageup_dbt_utils.mapped_pivot(
               column='form_attr.attribute_key',
               mapping_table=ref('ref_application_form_fields'),
               mapping_key='map_key',
               mapping_value='mapped_value_name',
               agg='MAX',
               then_value='form_attr.attribute_val_text',
               else_value='NULL'
           ) }},
           MAX(form_attr.model_timestamp) AS aggregated_model_timestamp

    FROM {{ ref('work_application_form_attribute') }} AS form_attr
    -- other joins

    GROUP BY xx.application_id
) new_rows

{% if is_incremental() %}
  WHERE form_attr.model_timestamp > (select max(model_timestamp) from {{ this }})
{% endif %}

{{
  config({
    ""materialization"": ""incremental"",
    ""unique_key"": ""application_id""
    })
}}
```

First, lets look at [mapped_pivot][pageup-dbt-utils-mapped-pivot]. This is very similar to the dbt_utils pivot macro, but uses another table to get a list of columns. `ref_application_form_fields` looks like this:

| map_key | mapped_value_name |
|---------|-------------------|
| 1       | APPLICATION001    |
| 2       | APPLICATION002    |
| 3       | APPLICATION003    |
|         | etc...            |

The end result is a model with around 100 columns and ~6 million rows. Meaning that there are about 600 million rows of source data (with some blanks).

For a full refresh/initial load this model is about as optimal as it can be. But for and incremental run there are some noticable performance issues. In fact, for my data set this model takes almost as long to run for an incremental load as it does for a full load (about 800 seconds).  So there is definitely some room for improvement.

**A solution**

What we want to do to improve performance is to be smarter about filtering out rows before they are pivoted. This gets hard though as if 1 attribute row is updated, you actually need every row for that application included to complete the pivot.

Or do you?

What if we could pivot only the changed rows, then merge the updated values to get the complete model? This is what I will show below.

First, lets move our incremental filter to where it is most effective.

```sql
    ...

    FROM {{ ref('work_application_form_attribute') }} AS form_attr
    -- other joins

    {%- if is_incremental() %}
    WHERE form_attr.model_timestamp > (select max(model_timestamp) from {{ this }})
    {%- endif %}

    GROUP BY xx.application_id

    ...
```

Now incremental runs will filter to only changed values, resulting in partial pivot rows.  Next we need to make some changes to the pivot, as to make use of this partial set of data we will need some additional logic.

```sql
    ...

    SELECT form_attr.application_id,
           {{ pageup_dbt_utils.mapped_pivot(
               column='form_attr.attribute_key',
               mapping_table=ref('ref_application_form_fields'),
               mapping_key='map_key',
               mapping_value='mapped_value_name',
               agg='MAX',
               then_value='form_attr.attribute_val_text',
               else_value='NULL',
               add_update_flag_on_incremental=true,
               update_flag_suffix='__is_updated'
           ) }},

           MAX(form_attr.model_timestamp) AS aggregated_model_timestamp

    ...
```

There are now a few extra arguments passed into `mapped_pivot`. You can view the [documentation and implementation here][pageup-dbt-utils-mapped-pivot]. But what is going on is as follows:


* **add_update_flag_on_incremental** has made the pivot include a new column for every pivoted column. This column is a flag to indicate if this value has been updated.
* The column will have the suffix `__is_updated`. The list of columns created will now look like:
  * `APPLICATION001` 
  * `APPLICATION001__is_updated`
  * `APPLICATION002` 
  * `APPLICATION002__is_updated`
    ...

So the pivoted rows are now prepped, next step is to merge them. The easiest way to do this is to link back to the existing model.

```sql
    ...

    GROUP BY xx.application_id
) new_rows

{%- if is_incremental() %}
LEFT JOIN {{ this }} AS old_rows on old_rows.application_id = new_rows.application_id
{% endif -%}

    ...
```

We have everything we need to build a complete pivoted row now. And we can write a macro to make the merge easy.

```sql

SELECT new_rows.application_id,
       {{ pageup_dbt_utils.merge_updated_values(
            new_table='new_rows',
            old_table='old_rows',
            unique_key='application_id',
            merge_column_names=dbt_utils.get_column_values(
                table=ref('ref_application_form_answers'),
                column='mapped_value_name'),
            update_flag_suffix='__is_updated',
            else_value='NULL'
        ) }},
       new_rows.aggregated_model_timestamp

       ...
```

You can view the [documentation and implementation here][pageup-dbt-utils-merge-updated-values] for this macro. Basically, it is talking a list of column names, checking the `__is_updated` column and picking the column from `new_rows` if it is updated, otherwise taking it from `old_rows` if it is unchanged. If the pivoted row is completly new, there is a default value to use.

Another key part of what this macro does is that it _only does work during an incremental run_. Otherwise it takes only the columns from `new_rows`.

The final completed model looks as below:

```sql

SELECT new_rows.application_id,
       {{ pageup_dbt_utils.merge_updated_values(
            new_table='new_rows',
            old_table='old_rows',
            unique_key='application_id',
            merge_column_names=dbt_utils.get_column_values(
                table=ref('ref_application_form_answers'),
                column='mapped_value_name'),column='mapped_value_name'),
            update_flag_suffix='__is_updated',
            else_value='NULL'
        ) }},
       new_rows.aggregated_model_timestamp

FROM (
    SELECT form_attr.application_id,
           {{ pageup_dbt_utils.mapped_pivot(
               column='form_attr.attribute_key',
               mapping_table=ref('ref_application_form_fields'),
               mapping_key='map_key',
               mapping_value='mapped_value_name',
               agg='MAX',
               then_value='form_attr.attribute_val_text',
               else_value='NULL',
               add_update_flag_on_incremental=true,
               update_flag_suffix='__is_updated'
           ) }},
           MAX(form_attr.model_timestamp) AS aggregated_model_timestamp

    FROM {{ ref('work_application_form_attribute') }} AS form_attr
    -- other joins

    {%- if is_incremental() %}
    WHERE form_attr.model_timestamp > (select max(model_timestamp) from {{ this }})
    {%- endif %}

    GROUP BY xx.application_id
) new_rows

{%- if is_incremental() %}
LEFT JOIN {{ this }} AS old_rows on old_rows.application_id = new_rows.application_id
{% endif -%}

{{
  config({
    ""materialization"": ""incremental"",
    ""unique_key"": ""application_id""
    })
}}

```

And no post on performance would be complete without a pretty chart:

![Lovely|690x331](upload://jGyoqjGhQasljGiOpfCg99vvebT.png) 

~800seconds down to <50 seconds. Lovely :)

**Caveats**

This is not a perfect solution for all situations, it does make a lot of assumptions:

* This will not work if your source data contains more than 1 value for a given pivot key (eg if you are pivoting on count).
* Some database engines/models simply wont get any benefit from this. Either the system is already clever enough to optimize or there are other blockers to performance. So your mileage may vary.
* Does not work if you have a dynamic list of columns to pivot (but then incremental materialization hates this already).
* Efficiency aside, this code is nowhere near as easy to understand as the pivot we started with. This makes it harder to come back to fix, and for new users to understand what is going on.

Hopefully someone finds this useful.

if you can maintain a clear monotonically increasing primary key column with a consistent column name (let's call it  `primary_key`  for the moment), you can embed strong assumptions as code in a custom materialization - if your compiled sql should look like
```sql
[CREATE TABLE | INSERT INTO]{{incrementally_updated_materialized_view}} AS
SELECT *
FROM {{compiled sql select statement}}
WHERE {{primary_key}} > (SELECT MAX(primary_key) FROM {{incrementally_updated_materialized_view}})

then you can pretty easily template the whole thing as a custom materialization where all you need to do is specify which of the columns in <compiled sql select statement> is the primary key as an input to the materialization. If we call the primary key `incremental_key` and the incrementally updated model `this_is_fun` pulling from a table `fun.facts`, then your uncompiled sql might look something like 
```sql
#/path/to/models/this_is_fun.sql

{{materialized=simple_incremental, incremental_key='created_ts_utc'}}
SELECT created_ts_utc, foo, bar, baz

It is very possible to write super efficient dbt projects.  I would go as far to say that while dbt's first design goal is to make your engineering workflow easier, it's second is to make it faster to run. Recently my team scaled out our dbt-based data pipeline to work across 90 pilot tenants concurrently, executing every 15 minutes. I'll let you do the math on how many executions that is. Thanks to the tooling that dbt provides, we were able to get the average execution time down to under 2 minutes.

This is the result of months of dev, and there are quite a few things we learned.  Most importantly is to realise the tradeoff you are doing.  Beyond a certain point, **performance improvements come at the cost of increased complexity**. Complexity for your data analysts/engineers maintaining your models, complexity for your ops team maintaining your batching process. This complexity needs to be managed and mitigated to keep your code/pipeline maintainable.  So here are some tips for speeding up your code, and suggestions for keeping your code maintainable.

## Only do work when you need to

Less models to run is always going to be faster. If your EL tool has the ability to tell you what models have new data since the last time you started a batch, you can use that to build up a list of models to pass into dbt with `dbt run --models xxx+ yyy+ zzz+`. How effective this is depends on your sources and how frequently your sources update, it also depends on how you are combining these sources into models.

**Placing views in front of your source tables** is also very useful (and can help with basic data cleaning). Views for models are also good but be wary of potential performance impacts of views being used in downstream models.

Calling dbt with a filter on models sounds easy enough, and it has the benefit of not impacting your data analyst's workflow in any way. But it does introduce some larger concerns for your overall pipeline:

* Your EL process now needs to track state
* dbt needs to be told about EL's state
* dbt needs its own state to tell what it last processed
* What about when models change? Guess we need to check for that and `FULL_REFRESH` those models when they do.
* This is a lot of state to track, probably needs to be fault tolerant as well.

None of these concerns can be (or should be) solved by anything dbt offers. And some of these should be done regardless what frequency you run batches, as it is just good sense for automation.

## Faster models

### Incrementals

**`materialized=""incremental""` is your friend**. Incremental is the tool dbt offers to make fast materializations possible. Embrace its power, but you must also understand it. You should be very comfortable with how incrementals work, how your models are executed differently on full refreshes vs incremental runs, and know how you are handling data deletion if that is a thing in your system (in this age of GDPR, it's hard for deletion to not be required).  Having said that, try to replace all table materializations with incrementals.

Incrementals add complexity to your dbt project, as suddenly all your models require branching logic that changes the final sql. It won't take you long to realise that this code is very similar in almost all your models. It becomes boilerplate, code you can't live without, mostly copy/paste, but disastrous if it has a mistake in it.  At this point you should try to make the most of conventions in your code.

### Conventions / keeping things DRY

Incremental updates work by tracking some column in the referenced models and seeing if it is newer than the newest value in the existing model. **These versioning columns should be consistent throughout your project**. Same name, same datatype, same behaviour. Doing this means that your incremental logic will always look the same, and it allows you to macroify some [common patterns](https://github.com/pageuppeople-opensource/pageup-dbt-utils/blob/master/macros/sql/timestamp_columns.sql) in your models.

If most models have the same pattern for incremental logic, then this should be your next target for conventions.  Try writing an **incremental model that generates the incremental conditions for you.** @drop_database_public has gone into how this can be done above, and you can [look here](https://github.com/pageuppeople-opensource/pageup-dbt-utils/blob/master/macros/materializations/timestamp_incremental.sql) for an example that I use.

These conventions won't work for all scenarios (remember the 80/20 rule?). And the regular incremental model is still there if you need it. But you should be manually implementing materialization logic by exception, not by convention.

### Ephemeral vs work table

Ephemeral models exist to allow you to split up complex models into easy to understand chunks. When going for fast batches though, you should consider replacing them with work tables that are materialized incrementally. This can have a big improvement on incremental performance of complicated models. Do as many work models as makes sense for your model. This all comes at the cost of space, hopefully that isn't a huge concern.

## Measuring performance

dbt has a wealth of data about it's runs that it doesn't expose via the command line. Even when it does, you want a way to measure across all your runs. Odds are, if you are reading this, **you have a data warehouse, so let's use it**. Use dbt's start and end hooks to record when a batch started and finished, and with what parameters. dbt has a very detailed [result model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/api-variable#section-result-objects), dump **all** of it to your data warehouse.

Next, you probably have a fancy BI tool plugged into your data warehouse, so lets use that. You should be able to answer the following questions easily:

* How fast are my jobs?
* What models consumed the most time over the last X runs?
* Did my code change improve or worsen performance?
* What are the most recent errors that caused models to fail?
* At any given time, what is the maximum age of the data in my data warehouse?

It should be easy to see how this data can be used by you, and your data analysts, and even by your consumers.

## Where is the limit?

Table transformations are the slowest possible model you can have. But they are a good baseline, their performance scales with the size of the dataset, not the size of the new data.  At the other end of the scale there is the ""perfect"" incremental model. This model has the perfect query plan, has every index it requires, and only works with data that has changed.  The performance of this model scales only with the volume of new data.  This is what you want to work towards, though it can be hard to tell how close you are to it. But there will get a point where you will start writing increasingly creative sql to try to squeeze out a few seconds more performance.  Don't going insane trying to make it faster :stuck_out_tongue: 

Tests are an interesting use case, as they will never positively affect your the speed of your runs. I feel they still have value as a way to sanity check that your models contain good quality data. Even then, don't test things that are already tested. For example, don't test a primary key is unique on a model if you already added a unique index as a post hook.

## Notes on scheduling

Not much to say here, whatever method you were using for a daily batch would probably work for hourly or less as well. One word of warning though, be very careful to ensure that you **never run multiple dbt jobs at the same time**. I've had it happen before, the results are not pretty.",4
557,"best-practices-for-frequent-batching","can you expand on 'never run multiple dbt jobs' at the same time? please?",5
561,"how-do-i-specify-a-different-schema-for-my-source-at-run-time","Is it possible for me to specify a different schema at the DBT command line to override the one that is present in my source .yml file?

    database: ic_reporting

Currently all of my staging tables are referencing IC as a source.   I'd like to be able to change the schema to `icmysqlqa` when I'm running this code via my DBT Cloud job that runs for our QA environment.  For Production and Dev, I'd like for this value to be as is.

I also thought about creating another source called IC_qa but that would involve repeating the metadata I already have in the other source and that wouldn't be good for maintenance.

561,"how-do-i-specify-a-different-schema-for-my-source-at-run-time","Hey @chanwd - this is a great question! I think you generally have two options here:

## 1. Use a `var()`

In this approach, you can supply a variable on the command line (or in your dbt Cloud step) which renders into the definition of the source. In practice, this might look like:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: IC
    description: “IC data from MySQL Prod”
    database: ic_reporting
    schema: ""{{ var('ic_schema', 'icmysql') }}""
```

This configuration sets up a dbt [Variable](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/var) called `ic_schema` with a default value of `'icmysql'`. This value can be overridden on the command line using the `--vars` flag, eg:

```
$ dbt run --vars 'ic_schema: icmysqlqa'
```

When this variable is supplied, dbt will set the source schema for the `IC` dataset to be `icmysqlqa` instead of `icmysql`.

This is a pretty good approach if you have a single dataset where you want to toggle between dev and prod source datasets. It doesn't scale quite as well if you have more than one such dataset, or if you want to introduce additional environment-specific datasets.

## 2. Use YAML Anchors

The YAML spec supports [Anchors](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/yaml-anchors-960154027.html), which should work in dbt source definitions. Anchors (and aliases) could be a good way to maintain separate definitions for these sources without duplicating any attached metadata/tests.

In practice, this might look like:
```
version: 2

sources:
    - name: ic_prod
      schema: icmysql
      tables: &tables
          - name: table1
            description: ""abc123""
          - name: table2
            description: ""def456""

    - name: ic_qa
      schema: icmysqlqa
      tables: *tables
```

This config would create two difference sources with an identical set of tables. With this syntax, you can also overrides tests/descriptions for specific environments if necessary - check out the ""Override values"" section in the link shared above!

The big benefit here is flexibility: you can have a dedicated source for each dataset + environment pair. If you go this route, you can switch between them in you staging models, eg:

```
-- models/ic/stg_model.sql

select  *

{% if target.name == 'qa' %}
from {{ source('ic_qa', 'table_1') }}
{% else %}
from {{ source('ic', 'table_1') }}
{% endif %}
```

Let us know which of these you end up going with!",2
561,"how-do-i-specify-a-different-schema-for-my-source-at-run-time","Thanks for taking the time to answer my question so thoroughly and promptly.

I opted for the 2nd option and created a 2nd source to represent my QA database information while also leveraging the aliases to avoid repeating information within the yml file.

I then created a macro that takes two parameters (schema and table) and called it `db_source`.

Something like this:
```
{% macro db_source(source_name, table_name) %}

{% if target.name == 'qa' %} 
{{ source(source_name + '_qa', table_name)}}
{% else %}
{{ source(source_name, table_name)}}
{% endif %}

{% endmacro %}
```

And then referencing it in all of my staging table SQL as:
```
from {{ db_source('ic', 'fct_table') }}
```

The one thing I do want to point out with the macro is that the expectation is that each of your sources are distinguished by a suffix, so QA should have a section with the same name as production but with `_qa` to distinguish the yml source name.

Something like this:
```
sources:
  - name: ic
  - name: ic_qa

564,"testing-with-fixed-data-set","I would like to test our models with fixed test data, not the real data. These tests would verify the model output against a known input data. The goal is to separate the testing of the model logic and the actual data.

I'm thinking about seeding the model source tables with fixed data and then running the tests. We're using Snowflake and usually conduct development and testing in cloned test databases, hence truncating sources and replacing with test data is not a problem.

A problem I see with my approach is that these logic -tests would fail if run against CI or PROD databases, because there I can't seed the source tables. Is there a way to group tests and only run data tests for example?

Is anyone practising this type of logic testing?",1
564,"testing-with-fixed-data-set","Hey @jtke! Such a good question! I have done a version of this where I use fake data while developing models: usually my fake data consists of all my known edge cases so that I can check that my SQL works. Unfortunately, I usually only do that during development, and switch out my references to the fake data before merging the code.

However, I *have* thought about extending this to be more long-lived in my project! Here's what I would do:

## 1. Add seed files for your expected input and output to your dbt project

Name them sensibly, like `input_subscription_events` and `expected_subscription_periods`. Normally I like to design these seed files to have lots of tricky cases so I can be sure that my SQL is working as intended. Don't forget to run `dbt seed`.

If you want to run things with ""real"", but static, data, you could take the time to recreate the tables in a separate schema -- check out [this post](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-do-i-specify-a-different-schema-for-my-source-at-run-time/561/3) on some approaches there!

### 2. In your models, `ref` the static data

But wrap it up in some conditional logic! (Yup, you can `ref` seeds if you decide to go down that route).

```sql
-- subscription_periods.sql

with subscription_events as (
  {% if target.name == 'ci' %}
  select * from {{ ref('input_subscription_events') }}
  {% else %}
  select * from {{ ref('stg_subscription_events') }}
  {% endif %}
)
...
```

### 3. Add an ""equality"" test to check that the expected input matches the expected output

We use [this test](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils#equality-source) to check that two relations match exactly. You can see us use this testing pattern all throughout `dbt_utils` in its own integration tests (e.g. [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils/blob/master/integration_tests/models/datetime/schema.yml))
```yml
# schema.yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: subscription_periods
    tests:
      - dbt_utils.equality:
          compare_model: ref('expected_subscription_periods')
```

### 4. Run your test with `--target ci` 
The magic incanation here is:
```
dbt test --target ci
```
It should all pass if your transformations work!

But then when you run it in any other environment, that test will fail, so....
### 5. Parameterize the `equality` test to accept an `environment` argument.

You'll have to add your own version of the `equality` test to your project, and add an extra argument. You want to get to something like this:
```
# schema.yml

version: 2

models:
  - name: subscription_periods
    tests:
      - jaffle_shop.equality: # replace with your project name
          compare_model: ref('expected_subscription_periods')
          env: ci
```

I haven't done this last step for this particular macro, but I wrote about the structure of making a test environment aware in [another Discourse article](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/conditionally-running-dbt-tests-only-running-dbt-tests-in-production/322/2).

Now when you execute `dbt test --target ci`, you'll be comparing your static data. In any other environment, you'll be running the real-deal, and tests shouldn't fail in either.

Let me know how you go!",2
564,"testing-with-fixed-data-set","Hi

The approach I'm now pursuing is a bit similar, but I found it easier to use a separate run-unit-tests.sh -script to organize files to correct places and then call dbt inside the script. I have grouped data-tests by model under ""tests/"" and the setup script copies relevant tests under ""tests/run"" at runtime.

Test input data is in seed files named like ""test__<model_source_ref>.csv"" and I use a macro to substitute the real ref with the test-ref if target==""unit-test"". Preferrably I would like like to override ref() and make it do the substitution transparently. Don't know if that's possible. Anyway, I would like to avoid having all that conditional logic in the model file that you show in step #2.

I wish I could override project settings, like test-path, with command line parameters. Then I would not need to copy files around. Now I might end up modifying the project.yml in the setup script before running the unit tests, depending on how complex the seeding becomes.

This is still work in progress and not functional. Hopefully I get it working today.",3
564,"testing-with-fixed-data-set","I got the basics working and I can test a module with predefined data set. I made a bit ugly macro to replace the model ref with a test data source when target=unit-test. Any ideas how to make this better:

564,"testing-with-fixed-data-set","You can use the `get_relation` method here to do this a bit more cleanly ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/adapter#section-get_relation)) -- it's longer but IMO more readable.

564,"testing-with-fixed-data-set","I wanted to continue the conversation because I think having an easier method to do unit testing would definitely improve dbt.
In my opinion, using behave would be a great fit for dbt as it will make tests as readable by analysts as models are. I played with other methods but I think this is easier to read. Let's say we want to unit test for a model called ""fom"" that counts number of days in a month:

```
  Scenario: run a sample unit test
     Given calendar is loaded with this data
         | dt         | first_day_of_month |
         | 2020-01-01 | 2020-01-01         |
         | 2020-01-02 | 2020-01-01         |
         | 2020-02-02 | 2020-02-01         |
      When we run the load for fom
      Then the results of the model are
         | first_day_of_month | count_days |
         | 2020-01-01         | 2          |
         | 2020-02-01         | 1          |
```

There's a working POC in https://github.com/jmriego/dbt-bdd
Would something like this make sense? Any feedback would be great as we are prioritizing this again and would be happy to contribuite it to dbt if it's a good fit",6
564,"testing-with-fixed-data-set","@jmriego I've spent a few days working on something quite similar to this and I believe lack of self-contained unit-tests for DBT models remains on of the biggest painpoints for mature use of this project.  Most important to me is to create an easy-to-define unit-test format that does **not** require any changes to how existing DBT models are written so it can be used against any number of mature DBT projects with hundreds of models seamlessly. It should also require only having to define the fakes for a models' immediate dependencies, not its transitive dependencies.

I'm not keen on the recommended approach of a super-ref macro that may dynamically swap between real models and fakes, as now this feels like testing infecting the implementation. To test Model C which has depends on Source A and Model B, the general strategy for me is to create fakes for Source A (the relevant tables therein) and Model B, as you've done in your BDD `given` clause via dbt-seed. This sounds simple but a number of problems here:

1. The model being tested must be materialized ephemerally, or else the compiled sql will simply refer to the corresponding namespace in the DB giving us no surface to inject our fakes.
2. The model being tested must have its model dependencies materialized non-ephemerally or else the compiled sql will bring the model-dependencies sql in-line as a CTE which means we cannot inject a fake.
3. When creating seeds for the test's dependencies, there will be node namespace collisions between the seed fakes and the defined models (ie. the fake seed B vs. the Model B). These are sorta deliberate, as we want the fake seeds to be defined in the namespaces of the models they are faking, however DBT commands won't work on such a project structure as it must construct a DAG on all its invocations.

The main issue is that it is _quite_ wacky to get around some of the holes in DBT's internal APIs and in its current form it exists as a meta-program that makes external calls to the DBT binary rather than something easily pluggable within DBT. The program basically has to re-write the DBT project file (it must have different versions between creating the fakes and running the unit-tests to avoid namespace collisions when constructing DBT's acyclic graph) to inject a custom seed-configuration and make sure model configurations have the correct materialization strategy.

The program then has to create its own property-file to define the model-tests (which for now use dbtutil.equality) - the ugliness here is that DBT allow property-files to be defined in multiple files scattered throughout the defined project's source-path and there again will be namespace collisions. DBT does not provide a mechanism to ignore certain property-files or establish some order-of-precedence; it indiscriminately tries to load and parse all .yml extension files in the source-path, so now the program must *modify* any of these files, temporarily changing their extensions to force DBT to ignore them (yuck!)

I've gotten a working version of this, but not happy with the gross file-system side-effects and general hacky-smell of the process. The process fits terribly in DBT's existing abstractions and a more native-solution would be preferable. Until then, this is what I've settled on.",7
564,"testing-with-fixed-data-set","Definitely agree with you on that @clee , I both think unit testing is really important for mature use of the project and tests should not requrie modifying the existing DBT models.

The example I put there doesn't really use a super-ref macro but it still requires modifying the existing ref function. Using your example of testing Model C which has depends on Source A and Model B, the testing scripts will run dbt jobs but passing it variables looking like this: `{'A': 'testcase1', 'B': testcase1'}`

So the ref function doesn't guess where the test case should be but you can configure it at run time. As you I didn't find a perfect solution that would allow fakes but I think this is good enough for testing transformations",8
564,"testing-with-fixed-data-set","Hi, 

One thing that I've feel missing is the ability to control different aspects of a model during different tests. Ideally I would conditionally like to **change data source(s) based on which test is running** to add data sources that **can test both positive and negative cases**; as such global settings such as `env=ci` doesn't cut it (unless you want to sacrifice readability dumping all the test cases in 1 huge table and then filtering). 

I did a test with implementing a `cte` helper that returns the compiled code of a model. This allows one to switch out anything (not be most beautiful with string-replacements but works well enough, especially for high entropy strings from ref() and source() )

**Contrived example** 
`models/addder.sql`
```sql
    SELECT 
      *,
      a+b AS sum
    FROM {{ ref('some_other_model') }}
```

`/tests/adder_001.sql`
```
{% set model_to_test = cte('model.addder')
      | replace(ref('some_other_model'), ""mocked_src1"") 
%}


WITH
mocked_src1 AS (
  SELECT
    *
  FROM
  UNNEST(
   [
     struct(1 as a,  2 as b,  3 as expectedSum),
     struct(2 as a,  2 as b,  4 as expectedSum),
     struct(0 as a,  0 as b,  0 as expectedSum),
     struct(1 as a, -2 as b, -1 as expectedSum),
   ])
),

final AS (
  {{ model_to_test }}
)

-- Some SQL assertion based on the specific mocked data.
SELECT * FROM final WHERE sum != expectedSum
```

**The advantages being:** 
1) Pure dbt(Jinja/SQL); 
2) ""full control"" per test
3) No changes/branching/flags required in production models. 
4) Supports both virtual tables as per above and references to larger data sets / seeds. 
5) no yaml.
6) potential to be plugin free due to low code impact

**Downsides:** 
1) Using string replacements can be fragile. Works well for ref/source replacements since these are high entropy strings with low change of accidental replacements.
2) Requires a new macro (`cte`) in the DBT core but this was quite minimal.
3) The 10 line POC worked well in simple tests but might introduce unknown behavior that i'm unaware of.

I'm also considering if the `cte` helper should accept another argument which can override context-variables such as val(), maybe even refs but haven't been able to find a clean solution to do it yet.

1. Simple and integrated into dbt; no external scripts to run

3. Mocks and expectations are mainly defined via seeds (but they can also be SQL/macros/models if desired)

The project README has some more advanced usage, but the basic setup is really simple. Just create some seeds for your mock inputs and expected outputs, define your tests in `schema.yml`, and run `dbt test`:

566,"is-there-a-rule-of-thumb-for-what-to-put-in-a-macro-vs-a-user-defined-function","From a best-practices standpoint, what should go in a macro vs a UDF?",1
566,"is-there-a-rule-of-thumb-for-what-to-put-in-a-macro-vs-a-user-defined-function","First of all, it's worth asking: _can_ the function be written as a UDF? UDFs are scalar functions -- you can only use them where you'd normally write a `select` statement. For example you could write a UDF to get the UTM parameters out of a web address, but you can't write a UDF to run a query, hold the results in memory, and then loop through them (you'd _have_ to use a macro for that).

Assuming the thing you want to do  *can*  be written as a UDF, the next question is: can the function be written as a macro? There are some functions that need to be UDFs. A good example is a Redshift function that counts the items in a json list -- you actually need to write this function in python, and import the json package, and it's just not possible to do it in Jinja

OK so let's say you can write something as both a UDF and a Jinja function. Let's take a `f_date_to_string` function as an example. Here it is as a (Redshift) UDF: 
```sql
create function f_date_to_string (varchar, datetime)
returns varchar
 stable
as $$
  select
  case
    when lower($1) in ('year') then to_char($2, 'yyyy')
    when lower($1) in ('quarter', 'month') then to_char($2, 'yyyy-mm')
    when lower($1) in ('week', 'day') then to_char($2, 'yyyy-mm-dd')
    when lower($1) in ('hour', 'minute') then to_char($2, 'yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi')
  end
$$ language sql
```

In your model, you'd call it like so:
```
select
  f_date_to_string('month', created_at)
from ...
```
(Pro tip that I haven't included: you should consider putting your UDF in a schema!)


And here it is as a macro:
```
{% macro date_to_string(date_part, timestamp) %}
  case
    when lower({{ date_part }}) in ('year') then to_char({{ timestamp }}, 'yyyy')
    when lower({{ date_part }}) in ('quarter', 'month') then to_char({{ timestamp }}, 'yyyy-mm')
    when lower({{ date_part }}) in ('week', 'day') then to_char({{ timestamp }}, 'yyyy-mm-dd')
    when lower({{ date_part }}) in ('hour', 'minute') then to_char({{ timestamp }}, 'yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi')
  end
{% endmacro %}
```

And how you'd call it:
```
select
  {{ date_to_string(""'month'"", 'created_at') }}
```

Generally, the folks I work with are pro-macros: the macro syntax is a little easier to learn -- they look more like python and feel a bit more intuitive than the at-times weird syntax of UDF.

Personally, I lean a little more on the side of being pro-UDFs. Yes, the syntax is a little harder, but I think they are easier when it comes to actually writing your SQL -- with macros, you have to make sure you get all 'your' ""argument"" ""'quotes'"" right (which I rarely do first time).


Try both and see what you like! If you go down the UDF approach, [here]([https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/using-dbt-to-manage-user-defined-functions-redshift/18) is an article I wrote a while back about integrating them into your dbt project.",2
566,"is-there-a-rule-of-thumb-for-what-to-put-in-a-macro-vs-a-user-defined-function","In many databases, UDFs are only scalar. However, Snowflake does have the capability to do UDTFs (User-Defined Table Functions) which can return a table per se.

https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/user-defined-functions.html

Also, from a database performance perspective UDFs and UDTFs may out-perform macros, depending on how they are written, what they are doing, and what the database query optimizer can do with them.

I prefer to make my functions, well, ""functional"", that is, idempotent with no side effects. By the time functions are actually indepdendently reading from and writing to database tables, they are pretty difficult to test and get pretty ugly.",4

Honestly, I am surprised that more people aren't in this situation. Opening connections to places like dbt cloud (or even Snowflake :frowning:) is sometimes an unacceptable liability.

## :negative_squared_cross_mark: Usage statistics

As you won't have access to the internet anyway, it is best to turn off anonymous usage statistics.  They actually take a few seconds to realise they don't have internet access, so save that time.

For many solutions, they will be some variant of ""put a container in X"". Containers have all those great containery features, such as being able to deploy the same container anywhere etc. But for our locked down focus they also give us a way to pull dependencies. When creating your container image, gather all your dependencies at this point. This will mean you have nothing to do at runtime except call dbt.

Inside the running container you could also access environment variable or keystores/parameter stores to get the remaining configuration you need.

Here is part of an example dockerfile.

```dockerfile
# install dbt and only the adapter you need
RUN pip install dbt-core==0.14.2
RUN pip install dbt-postgres==0.14.2

# copy whatever scripts you need to run
COPY ./container_assets/*.sh /home/local/
RUN chmod +x /home/local/*.sh

# copy your dbt profile
RUN mkdir -p /home/local/.dbt
COPY ./container_assets/profiles.yml /home/local/.dbt

#Grant user permissions and switch to that user
RUN chown -R  local /home/local
USER local
WORKDIR /home/local

# copy your project directory
RUN mkdir -p /home/local/transform
COPY ./transform /home/local/transform

# run dbt deps to get dependencies
RUN cd /home/local/transform && \
    dbt deps

# on startup the pipeline runs
CMD ./dw_pipeline.sh
```

# AWS

# :negative_squared_cross_mark: Lambda

Pretty easy no for Lambda, if your code runs for longer than 15 minutes, it gets killed. No way to work around this.

# :negative_squared_cross_mark: AWS Glue

Seems like a very expensive way to run a long running script. @martin also mentions space issues, which means there may be a limitation on how big your scripts (which includes dbt) can be.

## :white_check_mark: ECR + AWS Batch

Store your job in a container on ECR, run it on ECS using AWS Batch.

Batch is a wrapper around ECS that is meant to allow you to more easily fire off jobs, and handle things like jobs with parallel tasks, job prioritization etc.  This is all very overkill given we are only looking to run 1 job at a time.  You will also need to put a lambda + scheduler in front of this to fire off the job however often you want. And you will need to query the api to make sure the last job finished before firing off a new one, which can be clunky to do with the batch api.

So why not just cut out the middle man?

## :white_check_mark: ECR + Lambda

Store your job in a container on ECR, run it on ECS using a scheduled lambda.

The ECS and AWS Batch apis are very similar, and you still end up doing the heavy lifting of scheduling yourself anyway, so might as well just call the ECS directly and have 1 less cog in the system that can go wrong.  This approach is very easy, can be automated, requires no internet access, and is cheap.

## ECS Side note - Fargate vs EC2 Cluster

General rule is, if you can fill up an entire EC2 Cluster with containers, it is probably cheaper than Fargate.  But that comes at the cost of having to manage the host vms yourself. And for dbt, you have 1 container that runs infrequently that barely needs any resources at all. 

Rough Fargate costs:  6 hour run of DBT with 0.25 vCPUs and 0.5 GB ram (yes dbt will happily run with that) and you are looking at $0.08 per run. Small enough to be a rounding error compared to your data warehouse infrastructure costs.

# Azure

I am not active on Azure at the moment, though I would love to see someone try and put dbt on Azure Functions using their premium plan, which removes the execution time limits.",2
575,"extracting-schema-and-model-names-from-the-filename","# Default Schema and Model Names in dbt
By default, dbt builds materialized models in the schema dictated by the user's profile `target`. Furthermore, dbt names the model accordingly using the filename of the model's SQL file. This is refered to as the model's ""alias"".

For example, let's suppose I'm doing some analysis on some Stripe payment data. If my target schema is `dbt_brandyn` and I have a model called `payments.sql`, the defaults described above would build my model in `dbt_brandyn.payments`. This is a great default for quick prototypes and small transformation pipelines. However, once you start implementing large dbt projects into production, you can imagine the need for more flexibility in where tables and views are materialized.

A while ago, dbt added the `schema` and `alias` parameters for models. Suppose we edit `payments.sql` to include the following configuration:
```sql
-- models/stripe_payments.sql
{{ config(schema='stripe', alias='payments', ...) }}
select ...
```
Then, in this case, the model is materialized as `dbt_brandyn_stripe.payments`. This might not be the schema that you'd prefer, but this points to the flexibility of dbt's architecture. Somewhere in dbt's code base, dynamic schema names and aliases are being generated. In fact, they are being generated by the `generate_schema_name` macro ([code here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/fe48478993b299b66a337f84989d8d0f9ca3dcdc/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/etc/get_custom_schema.sql#L17)) and the `generate_alias_name` macro ([code here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/fe48478993b299b66a337f84989d8d0f9ca3dcdc/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/etc/get_custom_alias.sql#L15)). It's worth reviewing those snippets and convincing yourself that they do, in fact, produce the results above.

# Our First Override
What's more, you can override these macros in your dbt project. Using an override, you can effectively define a function that specifies the schema and alias for each model based on parameters in your profile (e.g., `target`, if you want to distinguish between `dev` and `prod` runs) and many of the properties intrinsic to each node (e.g., it's name, config parameters like `schema` and `alias`, tags, materialization strategy, etc). It's extremely flexible and details for overriding these macros can be found in dbt's documentation.

We would probably prefer to materialize `payments.sql` as `stripe.payments` in our warehouse. In order to do so, we can override the `generate_schema_name` macro as follows:
```sql
-- macros/custom_naming_macros.sql
{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name, node) -%}
  {%- set default_schema = target.schema -%}
  {%- if custom_schema_name is none -%}
    {{ default_schema }}
  {%- else -%}
    {{ custom_schema_name | trim }}
  {%- endif -%}
{%- endmacro %}
```
Furthermore, let's say you have payments from two different sources: `stripe` and `braintree`. You might want to materialize one model as `stripe.payments` in your warehouse, and the other as `braintree.payments`. In dbt, you can't have two files with the same name, so instead of calling them `stripe/payments.sql` and `braintree/payments.sql`, you need to have distinct names (like `stripe_payments.sql` and `braintree_payments.sql`). Use the `schema` and `alias` parameters as above. For example:
```sql
-- models/stripe_payments.sql
{{ config(schema='stripe', alias='payments', ...) }}
select ...

-- models/braintree_payments.sql
{{ config(schema='braintree', alias='payments', ...) }}
select ...
```
# A More Advanced Example: Using the Filename
I'd like to provide an example of how we use these macros at my company. In particular, we have a number of contributors working in a Redshift warehouse. Our contributors are not super users and each has a staging schema like described earlier; mine is `dbt_brandyn`. When a user sets up their `dev` target in their profile, this will be the `schema` they use.

We settled on a naming convention for models that are materialized as tables and views. They are always named `schemaname__modelname.sql`, with two underscores separating `schemaname` and `modelname`. In production, we want these models to be materialized at `schemaname.modelname`. This naming convention also makes it obvious what table your referencing when you use `ref('schemaname__modelname')`.

However, when a user is developing, we need to build these models in the user's staging schema. We need to be careful not to materialize at `dbt_brandyn.modelname` because that would result in potential name collisions (e.g., in the payments example above, we can't materialize the Stripe payments and Braintree payments both at `dbt_brandyn.payments`). We settled on the following format: if I'm building a model in my staging schema using the `dev` target, it should be built to `dbt_brandyn.schemaname__modelname`.

Once we agreed on the above convention, we set out to make dbt do that. We override `generate_schema_name` and `generate_alias_name` as follows:
```sql
-- macros/custom_naming_macros.sql

{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name=none, node=none) -%}
  {%- if target.name == 'dev' -%}
    {{ target.schema }}
  {%- elif target.name == 'prod' and custom_schema_name is not none -%}
    {{ custom_schema_name | trim }}
  {%- elif target.name == 'prod' and custom_schema_name is none -%}
    {% set node_name = node.name %}
    {% set split_name = node_name.split('__') %}
    {{ split_name[0] | trim }}
  {%- else -%}
    {{ target.schema }}
  {%- endif -%}
{%- endmacro %}

{% macro generate_alias_name(custom_alias_name=none, node=none) -%}
  {%- if target.name == 'dev' and custom_alias_name is none -%}
    {{ node.name }}
  {%- elif target.name == 'dev' and custom_alias_name is not none -%}
    {{ custom_alias_name | trim }}
  {%- elif target.name == 'prod' and custom_alias_name is not none -%}
    {{ custom_alias_name | trim }}
  {%- elif target.name == 'prod' and custom_alias_name is none -%}
    {% set node_name = node.name %}
    {% set split_name = node_name.split('__') %}
    {{ split_name[1] | trim }}
  {%- else -%}
    {{ node.name }}
  {%- endif -%}
{%- endmacro %}
```
Note that via this implementation, contributors do not need to specify `schema` and `alias` parameters; instead, this macro extracts them from the filename of the SQL file, which is stored in `node.name`. However, if `schema` and `alias` parameters are specified, they are used accordingly. If you want to disable the `schema` and `alias` parameters completely, you can remove that logic the from macro outright. For example, `generate_schema_name` would become:
```sql
-- macros/custom_naming_macros.sql
{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name=none, node=none) -%}
  {%- if target.name == 'dev' -%}
    {{ target.schema }}
  {%- elif target.name == 'prod' -%}
    {% set node_name = node.name %}
    {% set split_name = node_name.split('__') %}
    {{ split_name[0] | trim }}
  {%- else -%}
    {{ target.schema }}
  {%- endif -%}
{%- endmacro %}
```
In this formulation, even if the contributor adds a `schema` parameter, it is ignored by the macro. This could lead to confusion among contributors who are familiar with how dbt ""should work"". Thusly, I like to add a compilation error if a `schema` parameter is defined for the model.
```sql
-- macros/custom_naming_macros.sql
{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name=none, node=none) -%}

  {%- if custom_schema_name is not none and node.resource_type in ['seed', 'model'] -%}
    {%- set error_message -%}
      {{ node.resource_type | capitalize }} '{{ node.unique_id }}' has a schema configured. This is not allowed.
    {%- endset -%}
    {{ exceptions.raise_compiler_error(error_message) }}
  {%- endif -%}

  {%- if target.name == 'dev' -%}
    {{ target.schema }}
  {%- elif target.name == 'prod' -%}
    {% set node_name = node.name %}
    {% set split_name = node_name.split('__') %}
    {{ split_name[0] | trim }}
  {%- else -%}
    {{ target.schema }}
  {%- endif -%}

{%- endmacro %}
```

579,"can-i-create-an-auto-incrementing-id-in-dbt","TL:DR: No, it's not possible to create an auto-incrementing ID in dbt.

In fact, auto-incrementing keys in general are a bad idea. The alternative is to generate a `surrogate_key` using a hash, and test the uniqueness of this key.

## Auto-incrementing IDs in the time of ELT
This is good context for anyone that doesn't come from this background!

A long time (a few years) ago, SQL statements that were used for ETL usually had two parts -- the first created the table using DDL (data definition language), and the second inserted/updated/deleted/copied data using DML (data manipulation language).

Here's an example that should works on Redshift:
```sql
create table if not exists analytics.customer (
  customer_key     integer identity(1,1),
  customer_id      integer not null,
  name             varchar(25) not null,
  address          varchar(25) not null,
  created_at       timestamp not null default current_timestamp
);

copy analytics.customer (
  customer_id,
  name,
  address
) from 's3://<your-bucket-name>/load/key_prefix'
credentials 'aws_access_key_id=<Your-Access-Key-ID>;aws_secret_access_key=<Your-Secret-Access-Key>'
;

```
This approach was often required because the same engineers writing the code to transform data, were also loading it into their warehouse from an S3 bucket. These days, it's a good idea to use Stitch or Fivetran to get data into your warehouse instead.

In this example there's an auto-incrementing key in this query (`customer_key`). Often, an auto-incrementing key was used to create a primary key for a table, especially when there can be duplicate records for the same ""natural key"" (in this case, if a customer changes address, there will be two records with the same `customer_id`, but different `customer_key`s.

## Does dbt support auto-incrementing keys?
In a word: no.

Behind the scenes, if you materialize a model as a table, dbt uses a `create table as` statement to create that table.

Let's say that you already have your customers table in your warehouse, now you can run a query like this to create the `analytics` version of customers:
```
create table analytics.customers as (
    select
        id,
        name,
        address,
        created_at
    from raw_jaffle_shop.customers
)
```
^ This is kind of a silly example because in all likelihood, you'll be doing some transformation along the way, but it's just an example :)

We can do this because in dbt we **assume that data is _already_ loaded into your warehouse**, this is why we refer to dbt as being the T in ELT (extract, load, transform) process

The `create table as` syntax **does not support auto-incrementing keys**, since you don't explicitly define the columns. Similarly, it doesn't support column default values, constraints, or encoding.

## Why use the `create table as` syntax then?

`create table as` statements are so powerful because they allow you express your transformations as `select` statements -- there's no need to run two separate DDL & DML statements. In a dbt project, **every model is a select** -- dbt handles wrapping the select statement in the appropriate DDL.

Defining every model as a `select` enables anyone that knows how to write these queries to own the transformation layer. We frequently see analysts with no prior knowledge of DDL and DML get up and running with dbt really quickly as a result!

## Why do you say that auto-incrementing keys are a bad idea?
Auto-incrementing keys make it impossible (or at least very difficult) to maintain separate development and production versions of your transformations. This is because an auto-incrementing key is not [idempotent](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/understanding-idempotent-data-transformations/518).

If you were to create a development environment (say, a separate schema named `dev_claire`), and re-run all your transformations, the results of your auto-incrementing key would be different to your production environment. Maintaining a robust development environment is critical for a high-functioning data team, as it allows you to work quickly and test changes before deploying them.

## But I need auto-incrementing keys to track versions of a record!
One of the primary use-cases for auto-incrementing keys is to generate a unique, ""surrogate key"" in a table, where they may be multiple versions of the same ""natural key"".

For example:
* Your `customer` table has a `customer_key`, which is a unique, auto-incrementing key. This is required because your customer can change address over time.
* Your `order` table has a foreign key to customers (also `customer_key`). Since you're using `customer_key`, you can tell which version of the `customer` record was valid when the `order` was placed.

If you're using an auto-incrementing key on top of mutable source data, instead consider [snapshotting](https://blog.getdbt.com/track-data-changes-with-dbt-snapshots/) your source data and building models on top of your snapshots.

## OK, but I need a primary key for my model, what are my other options?
Yup, I agree with you there! We advocate for having a primary key (i.e. unique and not null) on every model. 

Every model should have some ""grain"" to it, i.e. what one record represents. For example:
* `customers` has one record per customer
* `subscription_periods` has one record per subscription, per valid period
* `ad_spend_by_campaign_by_day` has one record per campaign, per day

We use the `surrogate_key` macro from [dbt-utils](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils#surrogate_key-source) to generate a primary key based on the grain of a model. For our `ad_spend_by_campaign_by_day` example:
```sql
select
  {{ dbt_utils.surrogate_key(
      'campaign_name',
      'date_day'
  ) }} as ad_spend_id,
  campaign_name,
  platform,
  date_day,
  spend,
  ...
  
```
Behind the scenes, this macro hashes the combination of columns, which means that your resulting `id` will always be the same for a particular record. Or, put another way, the generated `ad_spend_id` is now idempotent.

## So how do I force my surrogate key to be unique/not null?
In DDL statements, when you define a table first, you can add these column constraints to your table definition:
```sql
create table if not exists analytics.customer (
  customer_id      integer not null unique,
  ...
)
```
Not so with the `create table as` syntax! So how can you enforce this constraint?

(As an aside, did you know that Redshift doesn't actually enforce uniqueness constraints? Check out the code at the end!)

In dbt, rather than enforcing constraints on the table definition and hoping the transformation fails, we instead state our constraints as assumptions about the results of our `select` statements, and then [test those assumptions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing). Here's a test to make sure that our `ad_spend_id` is unique and not null:
```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: ad_spend_by_campaign_by_day
    columns:
      - name: ad_spend_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
```
Behind the scenes, these tests get compiled to queries that return an error if the result > 0.
```sql
-- unique test
select count(*)
from (
    select
        ad_spend_id

    from analytics.ad_spend_by_campaign_by_day
    where ad_spend_id is not null
    group by ad_spend_id
    having count(*) > 1
) validation_errors

-- not_null test 
select count(*)
from analytics.ad_spend_by_campaign_by_day
where ad_spend_id is null
```

We can run these tests when writing code (since we can now maintain a separate development environment thanks to our idempotent primary keys), before merging it, and after our transformations have run in production. Basically -- we're going to find out whenever this assumption doesn't hold true anymore!

This pattern of testing is _much more powerful_ than column-level constraints, as you can define [custom tests]((https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/custom-schema-tests)) for any constraint that can be turned into a query. It's also much more readable IMO.

## Final thoughts
There are some teams using dbt who have tried to add auto-incrementing keys to their dbt models. If you go down this route, implementing dbt will likely feel like paddling upstream. To [quote myself](https://blog.getdbt.com/is-dbt-the-right-tool-for-my-data-transformations) (:roll_eyes:):

> dbt is definitely a _different_ approach to data transformation, and it could potentially feel a little unusual as you first get started. We encourage those who are just picking it up to find ways to work _with it_ instead of attempting to hack _around_ it: you may find that your code looks a little different than you’re used to, but we think you’ll be happier for it over the long run.

579,"can-i-create-an-auto-incrementing-id-in-dbt","@Kimcha As I understand it, the conventional wisdom against fact tables containing millions of unique `varchar` strings is based on storage considerations. (`varchar` is a byte-hungry data type, and global uniqueness means a given value can't be stored more efficiently as a numeric factor mapped to its original string value.)

One of the premises of modern databases, in addition to their columnar structure, is that storage is _cheap_—much cheaper than it was a few decades ago, when many principles of database design were canonized.

In fact, we've seen performance gains in Redshift by creating a common surrogate key across multiple tables that we can distribute and join on, rather than distributing evenly and joining on several columns at once. It's a `varchar` surrogate key, for instance, that powers our join between ad spend and session data when modeling UTM performance.

To take it a step further, we believe that storage is cheap and human intuition is expensive. To my analyst eyes, integer keys look like natural keys deriving from source databases proper; 128-bit hashes look like something produced as part of an analytics workflow. That ease of association is often worth a marginal increase in storage cost.

**That said**, there are functions available in most databases ([Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_STRTOL.html), [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/functions/hash.html), [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/hash_functions)) that enable you to create/convert and store your surrogate keys as integers.

**TL,DR:** The original macros in the [audit-helper](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/audit_helper/latest/) package were super helpful in making sure you don't introduce regressions when refactoring SQL. Now, we have new macros that help identify the problematic column when a regression is introduced.

## Auditing data: no longer my least favorite task in analytics
In my previous article, I shared how our [audit-helper](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/audit_helper/latest/) package can be used to help confirm that two queries  that _should_ give you the same results are _actually_ giving you the same results. Essentially, that you haven't introduced a regression.

I've been using it pretty heavily while migrating some legacy ETL code into dbt, and then refactoring it to make it follow our coding conventions, all while checking I'm doing a ""like for like"" replacement. And it's been going great! 

**If you find yourself refactoring SQL, you should definitely give this package a go.**

## Until it suddenly was my least favorite task again
Unfortunately, there have been a few cases lately where I _have_ introduced regressions to my SQL. Now I needed to dive into why my records weren't matching up.

### Problem 1: Mismatching column types

During a recent model migration, I went to run my validation query to compare my old relation to my new one, and I got this back:
```
[Amazon](500310) Invalid operation: UNION types character varying and bigint cannot be matched;
```
Cool cool cool.

![giphy%20(1)|500x180](upload://gliN75gZ1jYfggp4rvAEwyvSxHu.gif)

So one of my columns in my old relation is a `character varying`, whereas the new one is a `bigint`. But which column?!

The relation I was moving over to dbt was pretty wide (~40 columns), so I didn't want to inspect this by visually checking the results if I were to `select * from` my relation. Instead, I chose to query `information_schema.columns` to compare the column types, and check the the output of that query:

```sql
with a_cols as (
    select 
      * 
    from information_schema.columns
    where table_schema = 'old_etl_schema'
      and table_name = 'fct_orders'
),

b_cols as (
    select 
      * 
    from information_schema.columns
    where table_schema = 'dbt_claire'
      and table_name = 'fct_orders'
)

select
    column_name,
    a_cols.ordinal_position as a_ordinal_position,
    b_cols.ordinal_position as b_ordinal_position,
    a_cols.data_type as a_data_type,
    b_cols.data_type as b_data_type
from a_cols
full outer join b_cols using (column_name)
order by a_ordinal_position, b_ordinal_position

```
:point_up: :face_with_monocle: Oooh, the rare `full outer join` spotted in the wild! 

(If you aren't on Redshift skip this paragraph. If you are, my condolences....)

But it turns out that one of my relations is a [late binding view](https://blog.getdbt.com/using-redshift-s-late-binding-views-with-dbt/), and Redshift doesn't store late binding view columns in the the information schema. If I wanted to get the column types from this early binding view, I either had to:
* switch it to being an early-binding view, or
* instead query `pg_get_late_binding_view_cols()` ([docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/PG_GET_LATE_BINDING_VIEW_COLS.html))

![image|112x112,20%](upload://3tZ0Zv7iF7ffoC7wVUUPKj2wOii.png).

I went with the latter, because fortunately, @drew has already done all the hard work to [write this query in dbt](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/23484b18b71010f701b5312f920f04529ceaa6b2/plugins/redshift/dbt/include/redshift/macros/adapters.sql#L71) (let's face it, he's the real MVP).

(OK if you aren't on Redshift, you can come back now, we hope you enjoyed whatever party you got to go to during that part, we're all jealous!)

And then because I never want to solve this problem again, and I don't want anyone else to have to either, I packaged it up in a [macro](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-audit-helper#compare_relation_columns-source) and added it to [audit-helper](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-audit-helper).

```
{% set old_etl_relation=adapter.get_relation(
      database=target.database,
      schema=""old_etl_schema"",
      identifier=""fct_orders""
) -%}

{% set dbt_relation=ref('fct_orders') %}

{{ audit_helper.compare_relation_columns(
    a_relation=old_etl_relation,
    b_relation=dbt_relation
) }}
```
The compiled query helped me quickly find my offending columns:

| column_name | a_ordinal_position | b_ordinal_position | a_data_type       | b_data_type | 
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------| 
| order_id    | 1                  | 1                  | integer           | integer     | 
| customer_id | 2                  | 2                  | **character varying** | **bigint**     | 
| ...         | ...                | ...                | ...               | ...         | 

Once I found that `customer_id` was the issue,  I was able to cast it to the correct data type, and run my `compare_relations` query.

### Problem 2: Lots of rows that don't match
So once I could run my comparison query, it turned out that **my records did not match up across my two relations**. In fact, almost 5k of my records didn't match:
| in_a  | in_b  | count | 
|-------|-------|-------:| 
| true  | true  | 35 657 | 
| true  | false |   4 805 | 
| false | true  | 4 774 | 

![image|112x112,20%](upload://3tZ0Zv7iF7ffoC7wVUUPKj2wOii.png) ![image|112x112,20%](upload://3tZ0Zv7iF7ffoC7wVUUPKj2wOii.png)

With almost 5k records, and 40 columns, this wasn't going to be something I could (read: wanted to) debug by hand.

The solution? A macro ofc! I wrote a macro where, for a given primary key (used to match records), and for a given column, it would tell me whether the values matched across two relations. Here's the SQL for comparing the `status` column:
```sql
with a_query as (
    select * from old_etl_schema.fct_orders
),

b_query as (
    select * from dbt_claire.fct_orders
),

joined as (
    select
        order_id
        a_query.status as a_query_value,
        b_query.status as b_query_value,
        case
          when a_query.status = b_query.status
            then '✅: perfect match'
          ...
        end as match_status
    from a_query
    full outer join b_query using (order_id)
),

final as (
    select
        match_status,
        count(*) as count_records
    from joined
    group by 1
)

select * from final
```
:point_up: :face_with_monocle: _Another_ `full outer join`! So cool! And is that an _emoji_ in a query output? I've gone too far. Someone save me from myself, please.

Again, to save myself from ever writing this again, and so others don't have to either, I've added it to [audit-helper](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-audit-helper/blob/3b479d1d10d81a93ce6fa9a7a73eb41d6df92a20/README.md#compare_column_values-source).
```
{% set old_etl_relation_query %}
    select * from old_etl_schema.fct_orders
{% endset %}

{% set new_etl_relation_query %}
    select * from {{ ref('fct_orders') }}
{% endset %}

{% set audit_query = audit_helper.compare_column_values(
    a_query=old_etl_relation_query,
    b_query=new_etl_relation_query,
    primary_key=""order_id"",
    column_to_compare=""status""
) %}
```
Then, to make my debugging really extra, I iterated through the columns of my relation, and printed the results to the command line. Here are the highlights:
![40%20PM|541x500](upload://kn2z9uj3jSQqYBRzlIvfimCvKfK.jpeg) 

From here, I could quickly tell that it was my `status` column was causing a lot of issues, and could debug my SQL accordingly. (The full instructions for this usage are [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-audit-helper#advanced-usage))

`group by 1` makes the order of columns in your `select` clause semantically meaningful! As in, changing the order of the columns in your `select` clause could change your output if you use `group by 1`.

That's such a dangerous line to cross that it totally kills any value I might see in using `group by 1`. Maintaining SQL that uses this pattern become a dangerous exercise. You reorder some columns just because it looks better to you, thinking it's a harmless change, but oops! The output is all different now.

The author writes:

> Plus, as someone that writes  *a lot*  of SQL, I very much appreciate the fact that  `1`  is exactly one character.

I think this reflects a typical divide in programming styles and patterns. Some are optimized for the person writing the code, and some are optimized for the person reading and maintaining the code. `group by 1` is very much a benefit to the writer, and a harm to the reader and maintainer.

The author opens her [post](https://blog.getdbt.com/write-better-sql-a-defense-of-group-by-1/) with a choice between two styles of writing a query. But she misses a third style:

```sql
with enhanced as (
    select
        date_trunc('month', order_created_at) as order_month,
        *
    from core.fct_orders
)
select
    order_month,
    count(order_id) as n_orders,
    sum(revenue) as total_revenue
from enhanced
group by order_month;
```

If you want not to repeat yourself in your `group by` clause, then common table expressions are the way to go. For the sake of maintainability, I'd steer clear of `group by 1`.",1
640,"group-by-1-is-a-maintenance-problem","My 2 cents:

It elevates the choice of `select` column order from a harmless choice of ""better style vs. worse style"" to a critical choice of ""correct results vs. incorrect results"".

Can you give an example of a query with ""group by 1"" where reorganized columns would give a different output?

[/quote]

I am not concerned about errors, since those are easy to see and understand. I was concerned about a seemingly-innocent change in the query silently producing incorrect results, but indeed that doesn't seem to be the case due to how `group by` works.

I didn't think it through with a specific example for `group by` because my main concern is with ordinal references, and ordinal references generally _are_ a bad idea for the reasons I outlined.

An easy example is with `order by`:

```sql
select
    col1,
    col2,
    col3,
    ...
from le_table
order by 1, 2;
```

Changing the order of columns in, or adding new columns to, your `select` clause will change your overall result ordering. If you somehow build on this ordering with window functions, then it may also change the meaning of your results entirely.

Another example of how ordinal references can unexpectedly cut you is with functions that take positional parameters (as opposed to keyword parameters), where reordering the input parameters changes the behavior of the function:

```python
# Did I use the function correctly?
compute_result(input, lookup)

# Here, it's obvious.
compute_result(lookup_table=lookup, input_table=input)
```

So indeed, what I said here about `group by 1`:

> You reorder some columns just because it looks better to you, thinking it’s a harmless change, but oops! The output is all different now.

is incorrect.

However, though it's not as bad as I initially claimed, `group by 1` still introduces unnecessary maintenance risk due to its use of ordinal references.

For example, changing this:

```sql
select
    name,
    count(*)
from person
group by 1;
```

to this:

```sql
select
    city,
    count(*)
from person
group by 1;
```

will quietly produce different results. With `group by name`, however, the change will produce an error.

It seems like an overly contrived example, but in a large, messy codebase with multiple contributors, scenarios like this are possible. Data testing will certainly catch a problem like this, but this is a more difficult bug to catch as compared to a query that simply fails. Patterns that make bugs harder to create and easier to spot should be preferred to those that do the opposite.

So, though my initial claim was incorrect, I think the minor added maintenance risk described above, combined with the cognitive load of having to dereference ordinals to meaningful names, still make `group by 1` a bad pattern for code readers and maintainers. (And that goes for ordinal references in general.)",6
640,"group-by-1-is-a-maintenance-problem","Great write-up.

Not sure about these though:
> changing [query grouping by name] to [query grouping by city] will quietly produce different results

Wouldn't you *expect* it to produce different results, given you're changing the columns you're selecting?

>the cognitive load of having to dereference ordinals to meaningful names

You *know* that you're grouping by everything that isn't an aggregate, and if you've followed the advice to put all non-aggregates before all aggregates, I don't see why you'd ever need to mentally map the ordinals of a `group by` to the column names.  5 non-aggregated columns → `group by 1,2,3,4,5`.  Don't really care which column is 2 and which is 5, because it *literally* doesn't matter.

[/quote]

Yes, sorry, I should have been clearer. Of course, any change to the columns in your `select` clause will change your output. What I meant in the case of `group by 1`, though, was that the semantics of the query will have changed.

Maybe this concern simply reflects a bias I have. When I look at a SQL query as a maintainer, I treat the different parts of the query with different levels of sensitivity. To me, the `select` clause is the ""safest"" to touch, because modifying it simply adds, removes, or reorders attributes while returning the same logical result. And if I mess that up my query will quickly and loudly fail.

With ordinal references, however, that's no longer true. To return to my example, if I think I no longer need `name` in this query:

```sql
select
    name,
    count(*)
from person
group by 1;
```

and replace it with another column, not only have I changed what attributes the query is returning, but I've changed how the aggregation is being done. That's a more significant level of change -- a change to the meaning of the result -- and that's what I was pointing out.

In a world without ordinal references, I don't have to think that extra bit about whether changing the order or content of the `select` clause is affecting the semantics of my query. It simply changes the attributes being returned.

Hmm, I'm not following. My point is that `group by 1` is not meaningful to a human. The `1` has to be mentally translated into a meaningful name. In her post, @claire wrote:

> In my opinion, the second query is cleaner and easier to read. If I want to know what grain my report is at, it's easy for me to parse the  `1` , jump up a couple of lines of SQL and realize it's at the grain of  `order_month` .

This process of dereferencing the ordinal is a cognitive load. It's not an issue if you have short queries that diligently adhere to a style guide, but when you have large, messy codebase, this load can be noticeable. The load is borne by the person reading or maintaining the code, and less so by the person who initially wrote it. It can be avoided entirely by using CTEs and meaningful aliases, as I demonstrated at the end of my [initial post](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/group-by-1-is-a-maintenance-problem/640?u=nchammas).

I don't feel as strongly about `group by 1` as I did when I wrote that post. Thank you for helping me clarify my thinking there. But overall, I'm still against the idea. I think I've made the case as best as can be made, but having explained my thought process out loud, I'll take one final go at summarizing my argument.

Avoid ordinal references in SQL (including `group by 1`) because:
* They create a meaningless layer of indirection.
* They create an unnecessary coupling between the order and selection of columns in your `select` clause and the overall semantics of your query.

Prefer proper names and aliases because:
* They directly confer meaning to the reader.
* They decouple the details of how your `select` clause is structured from the overall semantics of your query.",8

Thanks so much for moving this to Discourse!

You're completely right, filenames for models in dbt must be unique, even if they live in different directories, or are materialized in separate [custom schemas](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-custom-schemas).

This is because the `ref` function only takes one argument -- the filename. I you try to have two files with the same name, dbt will give you back an error like this:
```
$ dbt run
Running with dbt=0.14.2
Encountered an error:
Compilation Error
  dbt found two resources with the name ""stg_payments"". Since these resources have the same name,
  dbt will be unable to find the correct resource when ref(""stg_payments"") is used. To fix this,
  change the name of one of these resources:
  - model.jaffle_shop.stg_payments (models/staging/jaffle_shop/stg_payments.sql)
  - model.jaffle_shop.stg_payments (models/staging/stripe/stg_payments.sql)
```

To get around this limitation, we often following a naming pattern like `<source>__<object>.sql`. For this example we'd have:
* `stg_stripe__payments.sql`, and
* `stg_jaffle_shop__payments.sql`

We've written lots more on the naming conventions we use over in this article:
https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355

Pro tip: if you consistently use the same separator in your filenames, you can actually tell dbt to use the first part of your filename as the custom schema, and the second part as the view/table name. @brandyn recently wrote a great post on this over here:

## Is it possible?

Can an organization's dbt codebase be split across multiple projects/packages/repositories? **Absolutely.** dbt ships with a first-class understanding of [packages](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management#section-what-is-a-package-), which are really other people's projects (or dbt's own) that sit beneath your ""main project""—your primary codebase and working directory.

There are many public dbt packages, such as the ones at [hub.getdbt.com](https://hub.getdbt.com/), but it is equally possible to install _private_ packages, as long as you have access to that package's codebase. For example, a private package may be hosted in a private repository in your organization's GitHub account. As long as your personal GitHub account has access to that repository, and your computer has an SSH key configured in your GitHub account, you will be able to pull down a clone of that repo upon running `dbt deps`. So long as you've properly configured a deploy key or the dbt Cloud GitHub app, your production runs will be just fine, too.

## Is it desirable?

We already create, maintain, and install **public packages** to do a bunch of things:

* Versatile macros, especially for “How to Write this in SQL” problems ([dbt_utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt_utils/latest/))
* Common staging models for one data source ([facebook](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/facebook_ads/latest/))
* Ad hoc queries you find yourself writing over and over ([audit_helper](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/audit_helper/latest/))
* Follow industry standards for boilerplate-yet-complex modeling ([snowplow](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/snowplow/latest/))

The chief reason for creating these packages is _reusability_. In all cases, though, we put in a _lot_ of extra work to make these packages as cross-compatible as possible. Where possible, there's handling for multiple data warehouses, SQL syntaxes, and data loading vendors. Packages like `snowplow` also include several configurable variables that change based on an organization's desired applications.

By contrast, you're the only ones who are going to be using your own data transformations. You know who's loading your data and which warehouse you're running on. The primary motivations to create **private packages** are driven by _people_ and _workflow_.

When I talk about using separate packages, I am talking about storing separate dbt projects in separate git repositories, where one is / some are ultimately installed as a package dependency of another (""main"" project). I'm _not_ talking about the following cases:

**Unrelated projects:** Two dbt projects that have no formal relationship. One doesn't `ref()` models in another or share any of its `sources`. This might make sense if you're using dbt to sub in for ETL-like operations, such as ""loading"" tables via postgres foreign data wrapper. You want to keep your true analytics work separate from code that is less dbt-onic.

**""Local"" packages:** Multiple dbt projects contained in the same repo. For whatever reason, it makes sense to have a separate project that is an extension or variation of its ""parent"" project. A good example of this is our integration testing setup in packages with good coverage, such as `dbt-utils` and `snowplow`.

## So, why multiple repos?

### git reasons

* You want different analysts to have different permissions on different repos.
* Too many cooks! Your dbt repository has dozens of concurrently open issues/PRs,
and analysts' work is overlapping or mutually blocking.

### dbt reasons

* Each analyst has to navigate hundreds of model files, when their work only touches a few dozen. (Not to mention the delayed development process of needing to run all those models in their sandbox schema.)
* Different teams have different code style, review process, and chief maintainers. Or, you might want to physically separate legacy cruft from net-new models guided by best practices.

## Is it feasible?

In any event, there are some real logistical and organizational challenges to
working across multiple repositories. Separating code does not _solve_ problems
of team cohesion; if anything it will exacerbate them.

| Motivation | Caveats | Possible approach | How could dbt better support this? |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Diff permissions on repos | Analysts can’t run dbt deps if they don’t have access | All analysts at least read-only on all repos. Data is permissioned, but transformation logic is still visible to all. | Env-aware deps, env-aware model enabling in dbt_project.yml |
| Too noisy, competing changes | Breaking changes are still there, but now quieter | Use GitHub releases. Full CI build of all packages (slow) | Version resolution for non-hub packages, or private hub. Smarter CI??
| Too many models | dbt run will still run `+my_package` | Analysts always run dbt run -m my_package only. Have a “superpackage” that installs all deps for prod runs. | A dbt run flag to only compile + run models defined in the current package? |
| Kick out some models because code style or legacy cruft | Someone’s package needs to be highest-up. Can’t ref both ways. | Pick the best-maintained package as “main” project. | idk! |

The big theme here is that teams need have mutual agreements (""contracts"") about what their sources, models, macros, and tests ought to do, and protocol around when and how they are allowed to introduce breaking changes. With that in mind, here are a couple scenarios where I think multiple projects make a lot of sense:

* The SLA between data engineers and data analysts is rooted in dbt `sources`. It is the data engineers' responsibility to ensure successful loading of data into the warehouse (or staging of files in external storage), registry as dbt `sources`, and guaranteed `freshness` thresholds. The package of unified `sources` could then flow into one or more dbt projects, maintained by team(s) of analysts.
* The forecasting & risk team wants to build on top of core business logic maintained by analysts in finance & operations, but they also wish to keep private their potentially sensitive modeling that projects organizational growth. They ""extend"" the main dbt project by installing it as a package dependency, pinning to a release tag. Crucially, they also keep an open line of communication with the analysts ""upstream"" of them, to prevent database errors that can't be caught by that team's CI.

I'm curious to hear what other folks have to say on the topic! Over the past few months, we've been witness to dbt rolling out at larger and larger organizations. The question of how to smartly separate analytics work across larger and more heterogenous teams is only going to become more important in the months and years to come.

682,"is-it-possible-to-have-incremental-logic-in-ephemeral-tables","I was wondering if it was possible to have an ephemeral model but to be able to use incremental logic in there?

The reason is that recently we were trying to move some of our CTE into ephemeral tables but we don't want to pull all the records every time our ETL runs.

A workaround to this is to create a CTE and include the incremental logic there (assuming the model is materialized as incremental).   The long term issue with that is if the CTE is useful for other new models, it would be nice to not have to repeat the CTE in that new models.  If we go the route of materialized it as its own model, then we start to clutter our schema with a lot of intermediate tables.

As a test, I created a child model that is materialized as ""ephemeral"" but contained incremental logic.

![33%20AM|690x269](upload://e5Bc2j20vyJi3VexbimUeRjKXaC.png) 

I then created a parent model that is materialized as ""incremental"".   I ref the child model.

![41%20AM|386x272](upload://4ZAE5Cz2oFHBEQGO93g6k4EvJ87.png) 

To test it, I ran the parent model once to populate the table.   I ran it a 2nd time in the hopes that it would interpolate the child SQL as a CTE within the parent.   It did not and pulled all the records, essentially ignoring the incremental logic in the child.  

Anyhow, I thought I'd share this particular experience and hoping that we'll have the ability to create incremental ephemeral tables.",1

712,"what-does-self-serve-in-analytics-mean-to-you","Nearly every client we work with at Fishtown Analytics talks about their desire to create a self-service culture around data. But this means a lot of different things to different people. I’m doing some initial research for an article that will eventually live on the dbt blog. If you have opinions on this topic, I would love to hear from you!

Some questions I’m thinking about…

**What does “self-serve” in analytics mean to you?**

* Really good reporting in a BI tool that most of the company has access to and views regularly?
* Power users that are not on the data team, but are comfortable doing some slicing & dicing on top of existing charts?
* End users who are comfortable creating charts & dashboards from scratch and even writing their own SQL?
* Something else?

**How self-service is analytics currently at your company?** Do users have the tools but aren’t adopting it? (or still just exporting data to Excel to do their own analysis?) Are they pressuring for more self-serve capabilities/training?

**How self-service do you want analytics at your company to be?**

* Which roles in your organization should be able to self-serve their analytics?
* What should stakeholders be empowered to do, and what should the data team be responsible for?

**What’s “normal”?** How self-service do you think a company should be? Are there companies doing an outstanding job on this? Do you think your company is normal-ish? Above average? Is it something you’re actively trying to improve?

**What are the barriers you’ve encountered to creating an empowered, self-service culture?** Are end users resistant to using a new tool? Is data too messy, complicated? Are you struggling to get buy-in from leadership?

**How important is data documentation in creating and maintaining a self-service culture?** Do your stakeholders currently read data documentation? Or they still come to analysts for quick answers?

**Is there anything you’ve found to be particularly useful in creating a self-service culture?** Training? Finding internal “data champions?” What’s working for you?",1
712,"what-does-self-serve-in-analytics-mean-to-you","To me the important thing to remember is that Self Serve analytics is a spectrum of different activities, but ultimately its anything that takes work, particularly repeating work off of the plate of the data team.

The simplest. but sometimes most effective way to enable self serve analytics is to build great dashboards and make sure your team knows about them. If there is a question you are getting asked frequently and you find yourself pulling the same data for multiple users, then it almost always is a good use of your tine to set that up as a dashboard (and schedule it out if appropriate)

The next level is _simple user engagement_ with your BI tool. The most common use case for this is being able to manage existing filters on a report (ie change the region from Americas to APAC). Basically everyone you work with can get to this level of fluency and it can help make your life a lot easier to train people to use filters. Another aspect that's along the same level is changing date aggregates (being able to switch a report that is quarterly to a monthly one without having to ask us). A half step up from this would be switching out a single dimension in a looker report. This level is really great because it cuts down on a large amount of requests and is also really difficult for end users to mess up.

The next level is the first level of what I'd call ""power users"" and its when users feel comfortable building their own reports in your BI tool. THIS IS A DANGEROUS LEVEL. While its great to have end users building out their own reports, you'll often find nuances in the data that they have missed purely by not being as close to it as you are. Our process for this is to allow users to build their own looks and dashboards, but we ask that they are all run by us before being put into use. It's best to focus on domain expertise here - so to get your marketing team comfortable using a few different dimensions and measures that particularly affect their team and have them come to you with anything else. In the long run you gain some modest time savings in the actual report building, but a lot of the true value at this stage is in increasing the data fluency of your end users. If you're using looker, it's helpful to have some stripped down explores for users on this level.

The final stage are your true ""data champions"". These are the people who know the data model almost as well as you. Not only do they build reports right - they surprise you in finding new insights in the data and new avenues for exploration. Treasure these people.

As for what level of self serve to expect and how to get it going, I've found that it all comes back to trust and relationship building. People won't really read data dictionaries. It's much more important to have good example dashboards and reports for them to build off of. Training people in the basics of your BI tool can go a long way towards them being able to organically pull their own metrics.

As far as what's normal - I don't think there is really any ""normal"". Whatever level works best considering your team, the technical literacy of your business users and the complexity of your data will inform what's right for your organization. Ultimately, the best thing you can do for self serve data is the same as the best thing you can do for non-self-serve analytics, which is focus on having a comprehensible, well maintained data model (if only there was a tool that was good for that...)",2
712,"what-does-self-serve-in-analytics-mean-to-you","**What does “self-serve” in analytics mean to you?**
In my view, it's imperative for domain owners to ""own"" their own data. As in, they need to know how to access the basic performance metrics that relate to their domain and be able to perform simple analysis to understand how to make decisions that they encounter on a day-to-day basis. Of course, you can't expect a marketer to run a regression analysis, but they should be able to find basic data about the performance of their campaigns (how many transactions did my email drive?) and be able to dig at least one layer deeper (how much was driven by different pre-defined customer groups?).

Ideally, business users would be able to construct their own basic reports and dashboards, but in reality, there will likely always be a few ""power users"" across functional teams who can assist their teammates - with final review from the data team. And, of course, there will be times where an analyst is needed to set up new reporting, which the end user can then access whenever they need it.

All of this depends on having an analytics team to make sure the data that's surfaced to end users is as clear and easy to use as possible, is accurate and reliable, and is maintained as the business changes. The priority should be automation and iterative improvement, so self-service for the basics can be maintained into the future.

**How self-service is analytics currently at your company?**
Not very self-service at all. We have an unfortunate combination of data access issues combined with not a lot of data literacy. 

We've been stuck in the era of Google docs that aggregate data from Looker reports and compare to targets that are housed in Excel. We have Looker built out, but it's overwhelming for end users, so only a handful of people actually use it. This is partially from poor set up and maintenance within Looker and partially because of the poor schema design of our analytical data warehouse in combination with compounding pressure from a changing business. We've recently launched Metabase, but our operational databases are too complex for a non-coder or non-analyst to navigate, so we're stuck waiting for our new data models to be built before we can really open it up.

Another side-effect of being stuck in the era of excel is that there have been only a few people who have built and maintained reporting over the years, as there are only a few who know how to work in Excel. This has meant that the company as a whole has developed a reliance on these few people to get all of their data and reporting from. Lots of ""where did this data come from?"" ""why don't these numbers match?"" ""why are we up/down compared to target/LY"" that those few people have been answering because they're the only ones who knew how.

**How self-service do you want analytics at your company to be?**
Very - for the simple stuff. Retail is not rocket science. Every person at the company should be able to build a basic report if they need to. Key people/teams (product, marketing, social, planning, merchandising, operations, tech) should be able to do surface-level analysis to inform future testing/improvement.

An example - marketing should be able to analyze creative performance reporting and assess the success of their campaigns (potentially in partnership with planning). A marketing analyst/data scientist can help with things like building an attribution model and identifying new triggers for marketing automation (things a marketer can't do on their own).

The value analytics can bring is in creating data models that are easy to understand and use, maintaining view-level platform(s) for end business user use, doing analysis that requires a bit more than slicing the data via an existing attribute, and helping to connect the dots across the entire org (facilitating collaboration and communication through the use of data). An analytics team can't do that if they're bogged down doing simple analysis that a marketer (for example) could be doing (and I would argue should be doing).

**What are the barriers you’ve encountered to creating an empowered, self-service culture?**
Once someone has developed a dependency on someone else to do something for them, it's really hard to break that habit, especially if you are pushing them to learn a new skill set. You just have to keep advocating for data, sending them the pre-made reports that you've created, and showing them how to do things instead of sending them the end result (if it's simple enough). Then they'll build confidence, you'll have built a collaborative relationship with them, and the trust will be there to build on going forward. Delegation is also important - if you're doing something that isn't driving value (copying numbers into a google doc), then try to find the relevant domain owner and give them the link to the Looker report or find a way to automate it away so no one is spending their time doing that.

Another challenge has been understaffing. Due to the difficulties with our existing ETL (among other reasons), our data team has slowly dwindled to two (soon to be one) analysts and a lone data engineer. There's only so much you can do with a data team that represents 1% of your global company and supports three markets, while you're trying to simultaneously prop up your dying ETL and build a new one. We've been hard at work building out the team roadmap, laying the foundations of understanding the value of data and good infrastructure, and advocating for additional resources.

Beyond that, for us, it's really just been about the difficult data models. But that's in the process of being fixed thanks to dbt + Fishtown and increasing support from leadership to shift focus toward the project.

**How important is data documentation in creating and maintaining a self-service culture?**
It's very important at Birchbox, as our operational databases have *nuances*. We're trying to find a balance though, as not everyone likes to use documentation. Keep the documentation within the data models rich for more in-depth users and future team members, but keep it light and simple for end business users.

**Is there anything you’ve found to be particularly useful in creating a self-service culture?**
Persistence. Advocacy. Friendliness. Compassion. Trust. Integrity. Transparency.

Tell people about the work that your team is doing and how it will benefit them. Listen to people when they're telling you about the questions they have or the problems they're trying to solve. Be empathetic toward them. Admit when mistakes are made and be clear about how you're correcting them. The people relationships are as important as the data itself in getting people to buy in. Constant reminders that you exist and are delivering value alone is powerful.",3

What are the barriers you’ve encountered to creating an empowered, self-service culture?
[/quote]

I've been working on ""self-serve"" at Dialogue a lot over the past few months and I think designing for it really comes down to this question. The other questions are really interesting, but for brevity and poignancy, this one covers a lot of ground. Ultimately, this question is what has helped us separate the problem into two parts:

**1. Technical expertise with SQL and data modelling:** These users know what data they're looking to analyze, they have all the definitions and business knowledge to extract insights, but they don't know SQL. We're solving this with tools like Metabase and more and more denormalization of data. Medical team members, for example, have lots of expertise but no experience with joining data. What we do to serve these members is take applications events and enrich them with dimension and facts about the care the patient had previously received.

**2. Domain expertise, an inability to discover data:** the more complex problem is when a user, such as a product manager, has a business question that they want to translate into a data question. For this case, we're still testing solutions but what we know is this has to do with surfacing the right data and making it usable for the end user in a seamless way. Right now we're thinking about Lyft's Amundsen and DBT Docs and a few others, but this problem is much harder to solve with a tool. In the mean time, data office-hours and trainings are helping fill this hole.",4
712,"what-does-self-serve-in-analytics-mean-to-you","**What does “self-serve” in analytics mean to you?**

As mentioned it means different things to different people and I recognise its ambiguity and definitional issues. 

Currently, I think of it as infrastructure that allows business users to easily access, engage and query appropriate data from the warehouse (semantic or reporting layer) and customise or augment data from warehouse with their own data to create a new curated set. 

I also see it as a spectrum as a opposed to a binary.

The infrastructure I spoke of consists: 

* Analytics tools (e.g. Tableau, Amplitude) 

* Context/documentation (e.g. data dictionary, analysis wiki pages) 

* Resources for learning (e.g. courses, workshops, office hours)

Thinking about data culture and where it fits into self-service is an interesting question. Perhaps we can say a strong data culture increases the take up rate of self service analytics. 

**How self-service is analytics currently at your company?**

Given the companies maturity and stage, confident it’s above average. 

Currently we are using Tableau and Amplitude as our two key self serve tools. 

In terms of other infrastrucutre we run Tableau workshops, provide data office hours, and hold a community of practice every 2 weeks for all business users interested in data. 

We have light metadata on our data (on Tableau Online and YAML files) and interestingly no data dictionary as yet. Although it is something we are starting to consider. 

**How self-service do you want analytics at your company to be?**

Make progress in getting business users comfortable so that a portion of ad-hoc requests can be done by themselves.

Also getting more predictive with our work. That is a number of functions in the business are in a good position to predict what will happen based on their data.

**What are the barriers you’ve encountered to creating an empowered, self-service culture?**

* Lack of data literacy and skills amongst business users

* Unaware of data that is available

* Keeping with the status quo

**How important is data documentation in creating and maintaining a self-service culture?**

As mentioned before have done little documentation, so perhaps a little unaware of the importance. Will have a better 

Sense when we do increase documentation and notice (if any) difference. 

But we have paid close attention to naming of events, dimensions, measures, tables and columns very very carefully. 

**Is there anything you’ve found to be particularly useful in creating a self-service culture?**

* Data Community of Practice

* Weekly Business Reviews with leadership

* Onboarding workshops for BI tools 

* Office hours

Currently working on a Data 101 course that covers data warehousing, data sensemaking (asking the right questions, systematically analysing the data from a number of angles, presenting results etc.), experiments, BI tools and more.

—

Agree with the thinking that has been shared here so far.

For me the shift in my thinking that has taken place over the past few months as our self serve infrastructure has come together, has been that it doesn’t remove the need for data analysts and the skill of data sensemaking. 

With my data warehousing background I have always valued well structured data sets and quality dashboards, and mistakenly felt that if we could achieve that, a deluge of data analysis and insight would flow from that.

I still believe they are important and necessary however what I’d acknowledge is that most “business users” like product managers have a lot on their plate already, and beyond understanding / reporting on their domain, it’s unlikely most of them will be able to dedicate the time necessary to deeply explore their data or make sense of it. That is where dedicated data analysts with specialised skills in the space can play a role, to produce valuable insights that won’t pop out of your standard dashboards or simple cross tabs and line charts.

My thinking has been informed by Stephen Few’s thoughts on the matter, but I’m only really grokking it now.

What I am really asking is there any data governance risk in using DBT Cloud in dev and prod vs. running DBT inside, say, a customer's AWS VPC.",1
720,"does-dbt-cloud-store-any-source-data","Hey @johnoscott! Great question. I'm going to answer based on dbt Cloud's current design and implementation, although it's conceivable that some parts of this answer could change in the future as the product evolves. If anyone is reading this in the _distant future_, feel free to ping me to see if anything has changed and I'll keep this thread updated.

At the moment, dbt Cloud stores the following data persistently:
1. your dbt Cloud account information. things like job definitions, database connection information, users, etc.
2. logs associated with jobs and interactive queries you've run. 
3. your dbt ""assets"": things like `run_results.json` and `manifest.json`. 

In #1, we can be sure that this does not include any raw data from your warehouse because we know exactly what type of information is stored here. For #2 and #3, that gets just slightly more complicated, because _you control these assets_. 

Here's one example: it's totally possible to write dbt code fetches all customer data from your customers table and then writes it out to the logs. This is almost definitely a _bad idea_, but it is possible to do. If one were to write this code, the logs would contain all customer data and therefore dbt Cloud would store it.

So, the more complicated answer is ""no, dbt Cloud doesn't store you data from your warehouse unless you specifically write some particular piece of code that will cause that data to be written to the logs, or to a compiled dbt asset."" :) 

Finally, dbt Cloud _does_ have data from your warehouse pass through its infrastructure when writing interactive queries in the IDE. If you write `select * from customers limit 100`, the data from your customers table will pass through the dbt Cloud infrastructure on the way to your browser. At the moment, there are no steps in that process that persist the data: dbt Cloud doesn't perform any caching or other behavior whereby that data lives on our servers outside of your browser session.

As a result of all of the above, dbt Cloud's data security / governance responsibilities are somewhat more straightforward than they would be if it were, for instance, a data warehouse or a data integration tool (both of which persist your data). Even so, dbt Cloud typically has to have a very high level of access to your data warehouse in order to do its job, and as such we take security extremely seriously.

724,"saas-multi-schema-best-practices","I was hoping to get some thoughts on what you would consider best practices for a typical SaaS situation:

* We are a B2B SaaS tool
* We use PostgreSQL as our main operational database
* Each one of our customers has their own schema in our database (all have the same data structure - we just have separate schemas to prevent leaks in case of bugs)
* There are many of these schemas (as in thousands)
* We also have a Redshift with lots of other data from Salesforce, Stripe, etc and currently use DBT + DBT Cloud to model that and prepare for our BI tools

For the sake of the argument, let's say we have a table ""sale"" in each of these PostgreSQL operational schemas. For analytics purposes, we'd like to be able to answer questions like how many sales there were in a given day, across _all_ of our customers, i.e. all of the schemas.

**How would you setup the data pipeline and model this?**

My initial thoughts are:

*Option A* - we could replicate all of the schemas from Postgres to Redshift using something like FlyData, then use DBT to create a view across all the ""sale"" tables across all of these schemas in Redshift. Not sure this would even work.

*Option B* - we use some kind of ETL tool to somehow listen to changes on all the ""sale"" tables in the all schemas in Posgres, then write a ""clean"" version into a unified ""sale"" table in Redshift. Not sure what tools would be good for this either.

Any thoughts and guidance would be appreciated! Thanks.",1
724,"saas-multi-schema-best-practices","I've got a similar (although not exactly the same) situation in both MSSQL and MongoDB (2 different SaaS products).  In MSSQL, we've got 1 database per ""State"" and in Mongo, we've got 1 db per customer.

Right now, for MSSQL, I'm using Stitch to replicate each table from the source db into its own schema (BigQuery dataset in this case).  I then use `dbt` to loop through a list of these schemas to create a monster view across all the source tables.  So if we've got 12 databases (again 1 for each state), then I end up with one `PurchaseOrders` view that essentially unions all the individual `db_{{statecode}}.PurchaseOrders`  tables together.  Then I can easily query across all of them as one - or if performance is an issue, I materialize it as a table.  With 1000+ of these, this seems like it might hit a wall, but perhaps not?

For Mongo, where my numbers are headed in your direction (we've got 100+ dbs today); I'm planning on rolling my own singer tap configs and just add the tenant/customer id as a new column for every collection.

              - not_null
      - name: orders
        columns:
          - name: id
            tests:
              - unique
              - not_null

  - name: shopify_uk
    tables: *shopify_tables

  - name: shopify_au
    tables: *shopify_tables
```

**2. Use jinja in dbt to union the tables together**
For our first version, we'll often just union together the tables manually (using a little Jinja to help us out)
```
{%- set countries = ['us', 'uk', 'au'] -%}
with products as (
{% for country in countries %}
  select * from {{ source('shopify_', ~ country, 'products') }}
  {% if not loop.last %} union all {% endif %}
{% endfor %)
),
...
```
Then, inevitably, there will be some table that has the columns in a different order. So we'll use the  [union_relations](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils#union_relations-source) macro from dbt utils here to help us out:
```
{%- set countries = ['us', 'uk', 'au'] -%}

{%- set shopify_product_relations=[] -%}

{% for country in countries %}
    {% do shopify_product_relations.append(source('shopify_' ~ country, 'products')) %}
{% endfor %}

with products as (
    {{ dbt_utils.union_relations(shopify_product_relations) }}
),
...
```
As the number of tables we need to union grows, we end up repeating the first 6 lines of this across multiple models. So we might then abstract it into a [macro](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/macros). Here's an example:
```
{% macro union_shopify_sources(table_name) %}

    {%- set countries=['us', 'uk', 'au'] -%}

    {%- set shopify_relations=[] -%}

    {% for country in countries %}
        {% do shopify_relations.append(source('shopify_' ~ country, table_name)) %}
    {% endfor %}


    {{ dbt_utils.union_relations(shopify_relations) }}

{% endmacro %}
```
Then our downstream model looks like:
```
with products as (
    {{ union_shopify_sources('products') }}
),
...
```
Even though we've reduced the repetition in our code, there's a tradeoff: we've obfuscated this code a little -- it's harder to understand exactly what's happening without going to another code location.

**3. Prefix unique IDs with country codes**
My last tip for this kind of work is that I generally create a new unique ID for the unioned data by prefixing the old ID with a country code, e.g. `US-187`, `AU-87546`. I find that this is the most user-friendly version of the unique ID, and it allows me to write clean `join`s downstream (since I also do this for foreign keys). In one project, I even went so far as to macro-fy this logic in my `union_shopify_sources`, so that any field named `id` or ending with `_id` automatically had the country code prefixed.",3
724,"saas-multi-schema-best-practices","Thank you @claire and @warpraptor - this is very helpful and great to hear what you're doing.

I had thought of something similar but ran into a couple limitations due to the fact that we have thousands of schemas and new ones created all the time (basically whenever a new trial gets started):

* A view would be slow at query execution time across that many schemas
* A materialized table would be pretty slow and expensive at dbt job execution time as we would recreate the entire table every single time dbt runs
* Stitch cannot automatically sync all newly added schemas from Postgres to Redshift as far as I know

Because of that, we ended up creating a slightly different approach and it's working great so far:

1. We added a changed timestamp column to all the tables in our production database that we care about. We use a Postgres trigger to update it on every write
2. We have a AWS Lambda function run every 30 minutes, iterate over all the schemas, query the tables with a timestamp cursor that we save for each schema+table in DynamoDB
3. Any changed rows since the last execution get batch sent to Amazon Kinesis Firehose, which writes them to a table in Redshift. These are the updates, not the final table. So for example we have a `sale_cdc` table that has all the changed rows appended every time
4. We have a dbt job that uses a window function on the CDC table to only get the most recent record for each unique schema + id combination and then materializes it into a final `sale` table that now contains all the sale rows from all the schemas in a format that is easy to use for further modeling and querying

Hope this might help someone in the future!",4

733,"testing-data-transformations","# Introducing dtspec

Hello dbt community!  I'm using this forum to introduce a new framework for testing data transformations: [dtspec](https://github.com/inside-track/dtspec). One topic that has come up in several dbt slack conversations and other [discourse posts](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/testing-with-fixed-data-set/564/4) is how difficult it can be to write tests that show how the output of a data transformation may behave given some variation with its inputs.  dtspec is designed to simplify the process of building test data and asserting how it should be transformed.

dtspec is a very new project.  We've implemented it at my company, InsideTrack, to test many of our dbt models.  I'm reaching out to the dbt community to gather feedback on whether this could be a useful
tool for other data shops.

## jaffle_shop

I've set up a basic proof-of-concept [dbt jaffle_shop project](https://github.com/gnilrets/jaffle_shop-dtspec/tree/dtspec) that demonstrates how dtspec can be used in dbt projects.  The interested reader is encouraged to review the [spec file](https://github.com/gnilrets/jaffle_shop-dtspec/blob/dtspec/dtspec/spec.yml) for that project, and even take it for a test drive locally.  Try tweaking some of the models or expectations to see what happens when the expectations are not actually met by the transformations.

One of the more amazing things that happened while I was writing the spec for the `jaffle_shop` project was that _I was wrong (gasp!)_ about how I thought a certain model behaved.  When I wrote the test case, I wrote it the way I thought the transformation worked, and dtspec alerted me that the expectation was not being met.  I was then able to dig into the model SQL more to figure out where my assumptions were wrong.  I then fixed the test case and moved on.  **This is the real power of dtspec!** Data transformations can get very complex.  Different developers, both new and seasoned, are going to have different understandings about how the models function.  If, based on our necessarily limited understanding, we modify the SQL in a way that breaks some known edge case, dtspec will alert us.

## Basic concepts

With dtspec, a user writes a **spec.yaml** file describing the expected behavior of the data transformations they wish to test.  dtspec uses this spec file to generate data that is then loaded into an empty test data warehouse.  dbt (or really any other data transformation system) is then run in that test warehouse.  The outputs of the transformations (e.g., dbt models) are then extracted out of the data warehouse.  dtspec then compares the actual results with the expected results defined in the spec file.  Any discrepancies are reported to the user.

The spec file contains a few key components, which are detailed below and include some examples from the [jaffle_shop POC](https://github.com/gnilrets/jaffle_shop-dtspec/blob/dtspec/dtspec/test.py).

### identifiers

A single dbt run in a modern data warehouse can be time consuming, even if the amount of data being transformed is small. dtspec is designed to minimize the number times that dbt needs to be run in order to be tested (in most situations, dbt would only need to be run once).  dtspec accomplishes this by collecting all of the data described in the cases and stacks them on top of each other.  Identifiers are used to declare which columns uniquely identify records as belonging to a particular test case.  See the [dtspec README](https://github.com/inside-track/dtspec#hello-world-with-multiple-test-cases) for more details on the topic.  In a lot of situations, we can get away with a generic identifier for the `id` columns:

```yaml
identifiers:
  - identifier: generic
    attributes:
      - field: id
        generator: unique_integer
```

### sources

The sources in a spec file describe the data transformation inputs.  These map directly to dbt sources.  The user can specify which columns can be used to uniquely identify records within a case by defining an `identifier_map`:

```yaml
sources:
  - source: raw_customers
    identifier_map:
      - column: id
        identifier:
          name: generic
          attribute: id

  - source: raw_orders
    identifier_map:
      - column: id
        identifier:
          name: generic
          attribute: id
      - column: user_id
        identifier:
          name: generic
          attribute: id
```

### targets

These are the outputs of the data transformations.  In dbt, these are known as models:

```yaml
targets:
  - target: dim_customers
    identifier_map:
      - column: customer_id
        identifier:
          name: generic
          attribute: id
```

### factories

Factories describe how to generate data for the sources to be used as inputs for data transformations.  A single factory can be, and usually is, composed of multiple sources that are in some way related to each other (e.g., foreign key relationships). Factories can be combined with other factories and tweaked for specific test cases, thereby providing a flexible mechanism for describing different data scenarios.

```yaml
factories:
  - factory: CustomerWithOrderAndPayment
    data:
      - source: raw_customers
        table: |
          | id    | first_name |
          | -     | -          |
          | cust1 | Kelly      |

      - source: raw_orders
        table: |
          | id     | user_id |
          | -      | -       |
          | order1 | cust1   |

      - source: raw_payments
        table: |
          | id       | order_id |
          | -        | -        |
          | payment1 | order1   |
```

### scenarios and cases

Scenarios and cases are the heart of dtspec.  Scenarios are collections of cases that share a common base factory and typically describe a single data target/model.  Cases describe the expected output of a transformation, given some inputs (inherited from the scenario, and often tweaked a bit).

```yaml
scenarios:
  - scenario: Building dim_customers
    factory:
      parents:
        # This factory is used by default in all of the cases that belong to this scenario.
        - CustomerWithOrderAndPayment

    cases:
      - case: populating number of orders
        factory:
          data:
            - source: raw_orders
              table: |
                | id     | user_id |
                | -      | -       |
                | order1 | cust1   |
                | order2 | cust1   |
                | order3 | cust1   |

        expected:
          data:
            - target: dim_customers
              table: |
                | customer_id | number_of_orders |
                | -           | -                |
                | cust1       | 3                |
```

### Testing output

The output of a run of dtspec (with a test case failure) looks something like this

```bash
Asserting Building dim_customers: target has data PASSED
Asserting Building dim_customers: populating number of orders FAILED
DataFrame.iloc[:, 1] are different

```


## Comparison with other kinds of dbt tests

dtspec is **not** meant to replace the schema or data tests that are currently baked in to dbt.  dtspec is meant to supplement these tests and enhance overall test coverage.  The dbt schema and data tests are tremendously valuable for ensuring the quality of production data.  However, they can be difficult to use to test hypothetical data situations or complex, record specific, transformation logic.  dtspec is mean to fill that gap.

## How we're using dbt and dtspec at InsideTrack

At InsideTrack, we're using dtspec to run over 150 tests against 50 models in a Redshift data warehouse.

For organizational purposes, we've split up our `spec.yml` file into multiple files and then process them with Jinja to knit them back together into a single spec file (and thus we get all the other great things that come along with Jinja).  Running all of the tests takes about 5 minutes, and we've built our spec parser a way to run just specific models and tests to speed up develoment iterations.

We've also got scripts to copy our production source data schemas into a small Redshift test cluster.  That test cluster is used by our CI system to run dtspec tests after every commit and prior to every deploy.

We're also toying with the idea of migrating our warehouse from Redshift to Snowflake.  In principle, we should be able to perform that migration without modifying any of the dtspec files.  We'll certainly have to adjust some of the model SQL to accomplish this migration, but once we can get all of our dtspec tests passing, we'll have excellent confidence that the migration will be successful.

735,"date-dimensions","Thanks @emilie I took a look at the date dimension code that you referenced. Looks like we have many similar columns. You also have some fiscal year columns that we don't. On the other hand, we have some additional columns like  DAY_SUFFIX (e.g. ""1st"", ""2nd""), WEEK_DAY_DESC (not just ""Wed"" but ""Wednesday"", ""Thursday), some keys like MONTH_KEY, and, most importantly, a holiday indicator and actual names for specific holidays.

Also I think some of the calculations in your date dimension could be simplified as we have done, e.g. instead of:

`FIRST_VALUE(date_day) OVER (PARTITION BY year_actual, month_actual ORDER BY date_day) AS first_day_of_month,`

you could do: 

`TRUNC(date_day, 'Month')`

for this:

               12, 'December') AS month_name,

you could do:

`TO_CHAR(date_day, 'MMMM')`

and for this:

    (year_actual || '-' || DECODE(extract(quarter,date_day),

               1, 'Q1',

               2, 'Q2',

               3, 'Q3',

               4, 'Q4')) AS quarter_name,

you could do:

`'Q' || EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM date_day)`

Just simplifying and making the code cleaner. You could also simplify many of the other window functions in the same way using the TRUNC() and LAST_DAY() functions.

743,"a-dynamic-schema-test-for-nested-repeated-bigquery-fields","Nested and repeated records (`STRUCT` and `ARRAY` of `STRUCT` types) in BigQuery are really powerful for performance and organizing, but can be frustrating to test in dbt because they require some extra SQL (namely, the use of `UNNEST`) to expose correctly.

I spent some time a few months ago working on a macro to dynamically unnest a column and run a not null test based on a `.` delimited specifier. I learned a lot about Jinja, especially its recursive capabilities. Here's how I did it.

## Example case

Imagine we have a nested order/order items table called `orders` that looks like this:

| order_id   | items.item_id | items.quantity | promo_codes          | address.city | address.state |
|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| 6301418492 | 13939         | 1              | []                   | New York     | NY            |
|            | 32482         | 4              |                      |              |               |
|            | 59221         | 1              |                      |              |               |
| 4929138818 | 13193         | 3              | [HOLIDAY2019, EMP40] | Baltimore    | MD            |

In this table, `items` is an `ARRAY` of `STRUCT` (nested and repeated), `promo_codes` is an ARRAY of `STRING` (repeated but not nested), and `address` is a `STRUCT` (nested but not repeated).

Our goal is to write a generalizable schema test called `not_null_nr` that finds null records in any kind of nested/repeated data at any depth of nesting.

We should be able to write our `schema.yml` file like this:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: items.item_id
    tests:
      - not_null_nr
  - name: promo_codes
    tests:
      - not_null_nr
  - name: address.city
    tests:
      - not_null_nr
```

## Writing the tests manually

Let's start by imaging how we would write these tests manually in SQL. If we want to test that `order_id` is not null, we can write a simple test like this:

```sql
select order_id
from orders
where order_id is null
```

If we try to write the same test on a nested, repeated field like `items.item_id`...

```sql
select items.item_id
from orders
where items.item_id is null
```

...we get an error from BigQuery:

```text
Cannot access field item_id on a value with type ARRAY
```

Turns out, if we want to test `item_id`, we have to `UNNEST` and join our `items` field to our `orders` table. Now our test might look like this:

```sql
select order_id, item.item_id
from orders
left join unnest(items) item
where item.item_id is null
```

What about our `address.city` field, which is nested but not repeated? In that case the test is simpler because we don't need to `UNNEST`.

```sql
select order_id, address.city
from orders
where address.city is null
```

But wait, there's more! It's also possible that we  have a field that is repeated but not made up of `STRUCT` types, like an `ARRAY` of `INT64`.

Take a look at our `promo_codes` column, which falls into this category. We want to make sure none of those promo codes are null. We write a test in that situation like this:

```
select order_id, code
from orders
left join unnest(orders.promo_codes) code
where code is not null
```
In this test we still need to `UNNEST`, but we don't need a `.` selector because the items in the array are not `STRUCT` type.

## Generalizing the schema test

So to generalize this schema test properly, it needs to cover 3 cases*:
1. The field is **nested** but **not repeated**, e.g. `{'item_id': 100, 'qty': 10}`
1. The field is **nested and repeated**, e.g. `[{'item_id': 100, 'qty': 1}, {'item_id': 200, 'qty': 2}]`
1. The field is **not nested** but is **repeated**, e.g. `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

**There is one more case, neither nested nor repeated, but I'm leaving it up to the user to run regular schema tests on those columns instead.*

The macro should accept the name of the model and the name of the field to be tested. We should be able to specify any depth of nesting in the field name, e.g. `level_1.level_2.level_3.level_4` and the macro should perform the appropriate `UNNEST`. This suggests some kind of recursion, which we'll get into in a minute.

## Constructing the macro

I start off by defining the macro itself and the parameters it should accept. It has to start with `test_` so dbt recognizes it as a custom schema test.

```jinja
{% macro test_not_null_nr(model, column_name) -%}
```

We're going to be getting into some nested loops, and Jinja doesn't have the ability to track variables from outer loops within the inner loop (see the section [here](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/templates/#assignments) on Scoping Behavior).

As a workaround, I create a `namespace` called `vars` with two variables, `level` and `column_list`, which will allow us to track some variables globally.

```jinja
{%- set vars = namespace(level=1, column_list=[]) -%}
```

Next, I split the `column_name` on `.` so we can see the requested levels of nesting and assign it to a new variable called `hierarchy`.

```jinja
{%- set hierarchy = column_name.split('.') -%}
```

I pull all the database fields from the model and get the one that corresponds to our top level `hierarchy` field so we have a rich representation of the column and its children. For example, dbt has a flag to tell us if columns are repeated or not based on the information it gets from the BigQuery.

The `selectattr` filter here gets the item in the list `columns` that has attribute `name` equal to the first element in our `hierarchy` list. 

```jinja
{%- set columns = adapter.get_columns_in_table(model.schema, model.table) -%}
{%- set root = columns | selectattr('name', 'equalto', hierarchy[0]) | list -%}
```
Now that we've set up our variables, I inject the basic SQL to construct the test, counting the number of rows with a `FROM` that corresponds to our first level (the model itself).

```sql
select count(*)
from {{ model }} level_{{ vars.level }}
```

Next, I'm going to recurse through the children of our `root` object until we arrive at the final level of `hierarchy`. Jinja2 has a [recursive loop definition](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/templates/#list-of-control-structures).

```jinja
{% for child in root recursive %}
```
The loop is responsible for generating the correct `UNNEST` statements to unroll the table to a state where we can access the final field in `hierarchy`. Within the loop, I do the following:
1. Add the `name` of the child to the `column_list`, which we'll use for creating strings like `level_1.level_2.level_3`
1. Whenever we reach a child that is a repeated field (as indicated by the `mode` attribute on the child), we increase `vars.level`, we need to `UNNEST` and join the field so we can access it.
1. If the child has a `fields` attribute, we need to go deeper, so I call the `loop` variable to recurse on the field that matches the name in the corresponding level of `hierarchy`.

```jinja
{% for child in root recursive %}
  {%- set vars.column_list = vars.column_list + [child.name] -%}
  {%- if child.mode == 'REPEATED' -%}
    {%- set vars.level = vars.level + 1 %}
    left join unnest(level_{{ vars.level - 1 }}.{{ vars.column_list | join('.') | string }}) as level_{{ vars.level }}
    {%- set vars.column_list = [] -%}
  {%- endif -%}

  {%- if child.fields -%}
    {{ loop(child.fields | selectattr('name', 'equalto', hierarchy[loop.depth]) | list) }}
  {%- endif -%}

{% endfor %}
```

Finally, I add a `WHERE` clause to perform the actual test. At this point, `vars.level` corresponds to the deepest level (the loop exited at) and we can build the field selector from our `column_list`.

```jinja
where level_{{ vars.level }}
{%- if vars.column_list -%}
.{{ vars.column_list | join('.') | string }}
{%- endif %}
is null
```

## The completed macro

As far as I can tell (I've tested this on a bunch of sample combinations), this works. Of course, adapting this for a unique test or other type of custom schema test will require more effort, but the bones should be there.

If you end up identifying any issues or improving on this in any way, let me know!

138 macros? Huh?

Well, this is a result of a pretty cool design pattern, which is that **dbt ships with its own global project**. Then, dbt overlays your own project on top of this project, resulting in the 138 macros! They're not in _your_ project, they're in the _global_ project!

If you dive into the [source code](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt) for dbt, you'll find a directory called `global project` ([here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/tree/dev/0.15.1/core/dbt/include/global_project)). In it, you'll find a file called `dbt_project.yml`, as well as a folder for `docs` and `macros`. Looks familiar right?

![Screen Shot 2019-12-20 at 3.54.14 PM|690x259](upload://ql6Z0SWUqPfB008IJJJJQ4SPrno.png) 

This ""global"" project includes lots of the snippets of Jinja that get used in every project, including:

- Materializations + the macros contain the relevant SQL to power them ([here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/tree/dev/0.15.1/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/materializations))
- Schema tests (which we just define as a macro that is prefixed with `test_`), e.g. `test_unique` ([here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/dev/0.15.1/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/schema_tests/unique.sql#L2)).
- The macro that determines the name of the schema that a model should be built in, `generate_schema_name` ([here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/dev/0.15.1/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/etc/get_custom_schema.sql#L17)), and the table/view name, `generate_alias_name` ([here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/dev/0.15.1/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/etc/get_custom_alias.sql#L15)).
- The default text for your overview when you run `dbt docs generate`, also known as the `overview` ([here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/dev/0.15.1/core/dbt/include/global_project/docs/overview.md)).

Take a look around, and you'll start to see some familiar things! 

If you dive deeper, you'll discover there's also some magic around `default` macros and `adapter` macros, as well as separate projects for each  `adapter` (e.g. plugins for [Postgres](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/tree/dev/0.15.1/plugins/postgres/dbt/include/postgres), [Redshift](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/tree/dev/0.15.1/plugins/redshift/dbt/include/redshift), [BigQuery](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/tree/dev/0.15.1/plugins/bigquery/dbt/include/bigquery) and [Snowflake](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/tree/dev/0.15.1/plugins/snowflake/dbt/include/snowflake)) , but we'll leave that for another article.

**Cool, cool, cool... so why am I telling you this?**

Well there's a pretty nifty design pattern in dbt — if *your* dbt project has a macro with the same name as one of the global macros, dbt will favor the macro defined in your project over the global implementation. You see this crop up in a few places in the docs:

- To define your own logic for schema names, add a `generate_schema_name` macro to your project ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-custom-schemas#section-changing-the-way-dbt-generates-a-schema-name))
- To define your own logic for relation names, add a `generate_alias_name` macro to your project ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-custom-aliases#section-generate-alias-name))
- To write your own overview for your docs, add an `overview` docs block to your project ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/documentation-website#section-setting-a-custom-overview))
- To override the default implementation for the `unique` -ness test (for example, to only test in defined environments), add a `test_unique` macro to your project ([Discourse example](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/conditionally-running-dbt-tests-only-running-dbt-tests-in-production/322/3)). Pro-tip: start by copying the code from the default implementation, and edit from there.

Broadly, I think it's pretty cool to just understand a little more of how dbt works under the hood, so I wanted to share this explanation.

Another great example of leveraging this design pattern is when you want to make changes to an existing materialization — for example Warby Parker wanted to adapt the `create_table_as` macro on Postgres to be able to use the `UNLOGGED` parameter ([Postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/sql-createtable.html). They were first able to test out their changes by adding a `postgres__create_table_as` macro to their own project to override the default implementation. Once they got it working as expected, they were able to [contribute it back to dbt](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/1650/files)!",1

I'm wondering what is the best practice of _where_ to do this casting?

For example, my first step is always to create a `base_` table that renames columns. Seems like that would be the right place to do the casting so that the types automatically propagate to downstream queries.

Another consideration is that when you CAST something you always have to specify the column name, which can lead to a lot of repeating as in Josh's example above.

That could probably be solved through a macro. I checked dbt_utils and don't see anything like that yet.

So then the structure could be something like:
``` sql
with source as (
    
    select * from stg.ga_page_stats
    
),

casted as (
    select 
        mcast(date, date),
        mcast(pagePath, varchar(3000)),
        mcast(sourceMedium, varchar(512)),
        mcast(campaign, varchar(512)),
        mcast(keyword, varchar(512)),
        mcast(adContent, varchar(512)),
        mcast(fullReferrer, varchar(512)),
        mcast(pageviews, int),
        mcast(uniquePageviews, int)
    from source 
),

renamed as (
    select 
        date as date,
        pagePath as page_path,
        sourceMedium as traffic_source_medium,
        campaign as traffic_campaign,
        keyword as traffic_keyword,
        adContent as traffic_content,
        fullReferrer as full_referrer,
        pageviews as pageviews,
        uniquePageviews as unqiue_pageviews
    from casted 
),
```

Or am I overcomplicating things here?",3

A single json object may be normalized (broken out) into multiple models, for example and order might have a total, some customer data, and have an array of items that have prices associated with them, I would build an order object, and an order detail (which contained the times in the order) off of it.",2
921,"unioning-identically-structured-data-sources","If you're working with an app that has one database per client, or a company that has one Shopify store for each ecommerce store they manage, it's often a good idea to union together each of these tables into one master table.

Here's how I would do it for a client that has a separate Shopify store for each country of operation.

## 1. Use sources
```
version: 2

sources:
  - name: shopify_au
    tables: 
      - name: orders
      - name: customers

  - name: shopify_us
    tables: 
      - name: orders
      - name: customers
```
Then, if you want to get fancy, use [yaml anchors](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/yaml-anchors-960154027.html) to reduce duplicated code:
```
version: 2

sources:
  - name: shopify_au
    tables:  &shopify_tables
      - name: orders
      - name: customers

  - name: shopify_us
    tables: *shopify_tables

```
This extends pretty well when working with lots of countries! Unfortunately at present there's no way to iterate over a list in your source definition.

## 2. Union together your sources in one model
For each table, I'd create a model whose **only** function is to union together the different sources (not to do any renaming/recasting).

**Why _only_ union in this model?** I am a big advocate for doing one logical thing in each model (when that logical thing is relatively easy to define), as it makes it easier to explain to someone what the model does. I like to think of things in terms of ""contracts""/a guarantee to end users, which says ""this model unions data only"", as I find these sorts of models are easier to maintain

In keeping with the [way we structure out projects](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355), I'd name this something like `models/staging/shopify/union/union_shopify__orders.sql`.

In an ideal world, where the tables have the exact same columns and the same column order, you can simply do something like this:
```
{% set countries =  ['au', 'us'] %}

{% for country in countries %}
  select 
      *,
      '{{ country }}' as country
  from {{ source(country, 'orders') }}
{% if not loop.last -%} union all {%- endif %}
{% endfor %}

```
:point_up: This has the advantage of being reasonably readable for someone who is still getting used to Jinja.
 
If your columns are in a strange order/some are missing from a table, you can use the [union_relations](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils#union_relations-source) macro to magic over that:
```
{% set countries =  ['au', 'us'] %}
{% set shopify_order_sources = [] %}
{% for country in countries %}
{% do shopify_order_sources.append(source('shopify_' ~ country, 'orders') %}
{% endfor %}

{{ dbt_utils.union_relations(shopify_order_sources) }}
```
OK, a little more complex, but you can still figure out what's happening!

From here, you can choose how much macro-magic you want to apply. Some options:
1. Use a `var` in your `dbt_project.yml` file to set the `countries` list
2. Create a `union_shopify_sources` macros that has the logic for building the `shopify_order_sources` list, so you can call it like so (obviously name it appropriately for your use-case)
```
{{ union_shopify_sources(countries=['au', 'us'], table_name = 'orders') }}
```
3. Parse the `graph` jinja variable (currently undocumented since it's liable to change) to dynamically build the list of countries without having to manually define it. Here's a hint:
```
{% macro get_sources(source_prefix, table_name) %}
    {% set sources = [] %}
    {% if execute %}
    {% for node_name, node in graph.nodes.items() %}
        {% if node.resource_type == 'source' and node.name == table_name and node.source_name.startswith(source_prefix) %}
            {% set new_source = source(node.source_name, node.name) %}
            {% do sources.append(new_source) %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    {% do return(sources) %}
    {% endif %}
{% endmacro %}
```
(This has the disadvantage of not rendering correctly in the docs)

**A word of caution:** All of these add complexity to your project — it's much harder for someone who didn't write this logic to understand exactly what is going on and make changes when required. Consider what's right for your use case — if you are unioning 70 countries and 45 tables, it is totally appropriate to use macros, but if you have 2 countries and 3 tabes, go with the simple version first!

# 3. Construct new unique keys
If you're using multiple shopify stores, and your source data uses incrementing keys, you're going to end up with `orders.id = 1` for multiple orders!

My preference is to construct new unique keys like `AU-1`, `US-1` instead: these keys are really easy to read and make debugging much easier than constructing a hashed key.

There's a few different approaches we've taken over time:
- The layer after our `union_shopify__orders` model is `stg_shopify__orders`, and we'll write the SQL explictly there (again, way more readable)
```
select
  upper(country) || '-' || id as order_id,
  upper(country) || '-' || customer_id as customer_id,
  ...

```
- We might get a little fancy in our `union_shopify__orders` model with some Jinja directly in there:
```
{% set countries =  ['au', 'us'] %}
{# assume all tables have the same columns, which is fine, because we are selecting * later based on this assumption #}
{% set columns = get_columns_in_relation(source('shopify_au', 'orders') %}

{% for country in countries %}
  select 
      {% for col in columns %}
      {% if col.name == 'id' or  col.name[-3:] == '_id' %}
      upper('{{ country }}') || '-' || {{ col.name }} as {{ col.name }},
      {% else %}
      {{ col.name }},
      {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
      '{{ country }}' as country
  from {{ source(country, 'orders') }}
{% if not loop.last -%} union all {%- endif %}
{% endfor %}


```
- If we chose to create our own macro to union together our sources, we might embed that logic directly in the macro.

# But what is we have hundreds of tables in each schema?
The above approach means you would need to create hundreds of models to create the union-ed version of the data (and each model would contain a call to a single macro).

At some point, this starts to break down. An alternative approach might be to use an [operation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/hooks-operations#operations) to:
1. List all the objects in a schema
2. Iterate through that list and create a ""super"" view in a new schema, which unions all the countries together — the code will likely look similar to the above macro
3. Create sources in your dbt project that point to the super view
4. Run this operation at the start of any dbt job

With this approach, you lose the ability to view the lineage of the super view in your project's docs (since lineage depends on using sources and refs), however it does declutter your project. FWIW, I think this approach is warranted when doing this at scale — if transformations are ""mechanical"" (i.e. easy to define expected input and output), operations can come in handy here :slight_smile:",1
921,"unioning-identically-structured-data-sources","Excellent write-up! 

Our team is taking a similar approach for making a master metric table that unions a bunch of staged metric tables together. We are using the `dbt_utils.get_relations_by_prefix` and `dbt_utils.union_relations` combination and found it very powerful and readable.

**Is it possible to force this ""master"" model to run after the staged models?** Our current approach is to run `dbt` twice, once with `--models tag:staging` and then `--models tag:master`.

So the `get_relations_by_prefix` macro returns a list of Relations (a view or table) in the warehouse, rather than a list of models. As a result, dbt can't infer the dependencies between the upstream model and your master model. 

There's no real way to fix this, your workaround seems reasonable! The other option is to use subdirectories to group together your models and run them like `--models path.to.subdirectory.*`

1008,"how-to-prevent-accidental-full-refreshes-for-a-model","A question that pops up once in a while on Slack is how to prevent full refreshes of incremental models, often because rebuilding the table from scratch would take many hours, or even multiple days.

Here's two ways to approach this:
1. Completely disable the ability to fully refresh a model
2. Add a protection layer to prevent accidental refreshes

**Approach 1**
Let's say you absolutely, positively want to prevent ANY full refresh for a model. You could add the following code at the top of your model:

```
{% if execute %}
  {% if flags.FULL_REFRESH %}
      {{ exceptions.raise_compiler_error(""Full refresh is not allowed for this model. Exclude it from the run via the argument \""--exclude model_name\""."") }}
  {% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

This can be read as: When executing dbt, if the --full-refresh argument is used, raise a compiler error and prevent the model from being executed.

Doing a `dbt run --full-refresh` will fail. If you have multiple incremental models and you are ok with the other ones being refresh, you would need to use model selection syntax to exclude the models that are disallowed to be fully refreshed.

**Approach 2**
A more flexible approach is to allow full refreshes but only if a specific variable with a specific value is present. This hopefully ensures that the action is explicit, and not the result of an accidental/careless `dbt run --full-refresh`.

We can slightly modify the code presented earlier to add an extra condition:

```
{% if execute %}
  {% if flags.FULL_REFRESH and var('allow_full_refresh', False) != True %}
      {{ exceptions.raise_compiler_error(""Full refresh is not allowed for this model unless the argument \""--vars 'allow_full_refresh: True'\"" is included in the dbt run command."") }}
  {% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

Almost the same code, but we're adding an `and` condition to check the variable `allow_full_refresh`, which has a default value of False if the variable doesn't exist when dbt is executed.

To fully refresh this model, one would simply run the command `dbt run --full-refresh --vars 'allow_full_refresh: True'`.

---

This is only an example. Instead of checking a variable, you could test on which environment the full refresh is executed through `target.name` to allow on prod and disable on dev, for example, or the role used on Snowflake via `target.role`.

If we were to migrate all of our reports using only Tableau Desktop, I estimate we'd need to spend hundreds of hours of developer time to accomplish it, which is just not feasible.  Fortunately, Tableau workbooks are just XML documents.  With the help of some code provided by another dbt community member (thanks Claus Herther!) I was able to put together this Python script to help with the process.  Hopefully other members of the community can make use of this too.

Tableau Workbook Redshift->Snowflake Migrator
=============================================
This is heavily based on previous work here https://github.com/calogica/tableau-redshift-snowflake-converter/blob/master/Tableau%20Redshift%20to%20Snowflake%20Migration%20Script.ipynb
This script converts Tableau packaged workbooks from Redshift to Snowflake.  It works by
parsing the workbook XML.  It will replace datasource connections so they point to your
Snowflake instance instead of Redshift.  Additionally, the script will UPCASE schemas,
tables, and any columns that don't have characters that need to be quoted.
Known limitations:
  - This will not work on converting published data sources.
  - Reports that use custom SQL may require additional manual configuration.
Usage:
  Ensure the following environment variables are set:
    SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME - Name of the snowflake account (not including the snowflakecomputing.com bit)
    SNOWFLAKE_USER_NAME - Snowflake user account name
    SNOWLFAKE_ROLE_NAME = Role to use for user (uppercase)
    SNOWFLAKE_DB_NAME - Name of Snowflake database (uppercase)
    SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE - Snowflake warehouse (uppercase)
    SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA - Snowflake schema (uppercase)
  Run the script and specify the path to the Tableau workbook, relative to this script:

1067,"dbt-bitemporality-and-snapshots","Bitemporality is the tracking, in a database, of two different aspects of temporal information associated with each tuple:

1. Valid Time: The time period during which a fact is true in the real world
2. Transaction Time: The time period during which a fact stored in the database was known.

I think we all understand why we need to track the notion of Valid Time; Valid Time is usually what is being tracked in a Type 2 SCD dimension. However, it can be helpful to also track Transaction Time to understand the difference or the lag between when a fact was or will be true in the real world, and when we became aware of it in the database. One application of this that I was recently exploring was trying to understand data latency from data being a) created/edited in upstream source systems to b) landing in our raw tables to c) being processed via snapshots and stored in a snapshot table.

I found that I couldn't really accurately differentiate between these steps because the details of how dbt processes timestamps and applies them seems to vary depending upon the snapshot strategy used. There doesn't seem to be a way with the ""timestamp/lastchanged"" strategy to actually answer the question ""When was this row written into the snapshot?"" because the `dbt_updated_at` column actually is set to the value provided in the lastchanged timestamp from the upstream source system, not the timestamp of being written into the snapshot.

So the challenge is that dbt snapshots, in their current incarnation, don't really differentiate between the these aspects of temporality. Or sometimes they are mixed depending on which snapshot approach is used. When using the `timestamp` strategy, which depends on a lastchanged timestamp coming from the source database, dbt uses the source timestamp in question to set the various dbt timestamps in the snapshot table (e.g. dbt_updated_at, dbt_valid_from, and dbt_valid_to). However, when using the check strategy, dbt instead uses the database time at which the snapshot transaction was applied or changed.

In the former case, whether the lastchanged timestamp is reflective of the Valid Time or the Transaction Time depends on the notion of what the source system is doing. It's more likely to be the Transaction Time but may not be. In the latter case of the check strategy, it's likely going to be the Transaction Time. This gets even more confusing when loading historical data all at once into a snapshot. It's not really clearly enunciated, however, and recently when I switched some snapshots from the ""check"" strategy to the ""lastchanged"" strategy (as a thankful result of us finding how to get lastchanged timestamps from an upstream SaaS service which is providing us data) the pattern of how the timestamps were written changed and I could see dbt switching from using the (BigQuery in this case) database `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` to using the values from the source system timestamp.

There is probably yet another time dimension to this in that the ""Transaction Time"" as per the source system we are getting the data from is probably different from the ""Transaction Time"" as per the actual database platform that we are loading the raw data into and doing processing with (like Snowflake or BigQuery). So perhaps part of my issue is also further differentiating between these two Transaction Times.

Many databases such as SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, Teradata, and others support bitemporal tables. Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift don't appear to support it but I'm not making an argument here for actually using database-engine supported temporality with dbt, but rather giving examples to show that the concept is well established and available in commercial software.

Also, aspects of bitemporality have been integrated into various ANSI SQL standards. I would be interested in having the notion of bitemporality more clearly explained and managed in dbt snapshots to help better with managing these aspects of time. Would others be interested in the same thing?",1
1067,"dbt-bitemporality-and-snapshots","I know this doesn't address your larger questions around bitemporal modeling, but I've recently started adding my own `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()::TIMESTAMP AS dbt_snapshot_at` column to all of my snapshots to track when the dbt snapshot was taken.",2
1067,"dbt-bitemporality-and-snapshots","Really good post Josh. It is absolutely true that the whole SQL ecosystem does a really bad job at properly managing the temporal aspects of data.

The reasons for this are many. The concept of transactions really messes up natural concepts of time - so that does not help. Just look at e.g. `statement_timestamp()`,  `transaction_timestamp()`, `clock_timestamp()` from Postgres,  and while doing that, note that they don't offer a `commit_timestamp()` because that is ""tricky"", although Spanner manages it with [`pending_commit_timestampp()`](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#pending_commit_timestamp) , albeit not as a value readable within a transaction of course. So, that means we have 4 DBMS timestamps before we start even looking at application generated timestamps. Typically these will be set close to, but rarely  identical to, one of the DBMS timestamps, and so can also be considered as a strand of ""transaction/recorded time"".

Other reasons include temporal being a bit of a backwater in database research. Darwen had to badger Date for many years to get him to take the topic seriously, and even then they focused on the consequences of interval (aka range) values/types to the relational model more than the arrow of time itself. Not does their ambivalence to transactions help (see page 447 of the 2nd edition of  [Time and Relational Theory](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/time-and-relational/9780128006313/), where they try and fail to answer their own question on ""how transaction timestamps might be implemented in a real system)""). Other, more mainstream(?) academic work such as [Snodgrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_database#History) notwithstanding, this whole area is under researched IMHO.

And I would say that most the work on Temporal Tables in SQL DBMSes has been focused on OLTP use cases, rather than analytical ones such as ETL populated ""type-2"" dimensions. Maybe this is not such the case with Teradata's implementation - but that not something I have worked with myself.

Now, Josh, you said at the start that ""Valid Time is usually what is being tracked in a Type 2 SCD dimension"". I would disagree. Almost always those tables hold one kind of transaction/recorded time. I.e. what did the customer record (that we extracted from the source) look like yesterday, a week ago etc.   Very rarely are business time columns used. E.g. if a customer says ""I moved city last month"" or ""I'm moving city next month"", the SCD won't be back or forward dated to reflect the ""true in the real world"" timeline.  We don't want our historic reports chaining just because a customer ""forgot"" to tell us something in due time.

Actually, the ""bi-temporal"" (end [""tri-temporal""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_database#Tri-temporal)!) stuff is all an unimportant distraction. Anything other than the recorded/transaction timeline is just normal columns. Recording when a customer says something happened in the real world, or when a fraud investigator says something actually happened are all just normal business data items. Trying to make them special under the ""bi-temporal"" (or should that be n-temporal) banner obscures the more important matter of the serializable nature of data recording.

So what to do? I'm sure dbt could pay more attention to this. Even simple things such as recording `dbt_snapshot_at` as @gnilrets suggests would help. Leveraging Time Travel facilitates (where available/performant) to ensure dbt knows what the snapshot point is in the local warehouse timeline, would also help. Understanding what any timestamps coming from the source systems actually represent would be better still (e.g. CDC'ed sources can sometimes include a true(ish) source commit timestamp). Still I'm not sure dbt really works at a high enough level of abstraction to incorporate such matters.",3
1070,"using-dynamic-schemas-for-snapshots","Unlike  models, snapshots build into the same `target_schema`, no matter who is running them. This helps ensure that whenever you `ref` a snapshot, you're using the production version of the snapshot, so that your dev transformations reflect reailty.

However, this can cause problems if you want to test the `snapshot` command in `dev` or even during a `CI` run, since the database user you run this command with in dev/CI may not have the correct privileges to mutate the snapshot table.

If this is causing headaches for you, there is a workaround! Here's how I recently did it:

### 1. Use the `generate_schema_name` macro to make the `target_schema` environment-aware
The `generate_schema_name` macro is how dbt constructs an environment-aware schema name for a model ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas)), and we can leverage it here to do the same thing.

Normally, I'd configure this directly from the `dbt_project.yml` file for all my snapshots to make them behave consistently. But for reasons that I'd prefer to not get into (read: I don't fully understand) we have to do this directly from the snapshot itself

`snapshots/orders_snapshot.sql`:
```jinja2
{% snapshot orders_snapshot %}

{{
    config(
      target_database='analytics',
      target_schema=generate_schema_name('snapshots'),
      unique_key='id',

      strategy='timestamp',
      updated_at='order_date',
    )
}}

select * from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'orders') }}

{% endsnapshot %}

```


If you're using [custom databases](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-database/),  it might also  be a good idea to do the same for your `target_database` configurations (i.e. `target_database=generate_database_name('analytics')`)

Now when you `$ dbt run`, the snapshot will be built in a different schema depending on who is running it.
For my setup:
```sql
-- in prod:
analytics.snapshots.orders_snapshot

-- in dev:
analytics.dbt_claire_snapshots.orders_snapshot
```

### 2. Don't `ref` your snapshots
The docs say you should select from snapshots using `ref`:

```sql
select * from {{ ref('orders_snapshot') }}
```

But, if you've followed step one, you really shouldn't use `ref`. This is because we want to make sure we are always selecting from the production version of the snapshot, not your `dev` or `ci` version. If we use `ref`, that won't be the case.

So, what's an analytics engineer to do?

#### Option 1: Use sources
Some folks have worked around this by choosing to define their snapshots as [sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources/), and instead using the `{{ source(...) }}` function to select from their snapshot. That's a reasonable approach, but the one downside is that you'll end up with two nodes representing the same thing in the docs —one for the `snapshot`, and one for the `source` that represents the `snapshot`. Not too bad of a trade-off in the schema of things!

![dbt-dag (1)|690x240](upload://uLrelqF4K5Gh8SdVWb8bwDMgWmw.png) 

#### Option 2: Create a macro to `ref` for you

What if, instead of `{{ ref('orders_snapshot') }}`, we could do something like:
```
select * from {{ snapshot('orders_snapshot') }}
```
And have it always compile to the production version of the snapshot, while maintaining the edge in the DAG between the snapshot and the model?

We can! (Quelle surprise!)

Here's a macro that I recently used:

`macros/snapshot.sql`
```jinja2
{% macro snapshot(snapshot_name) %}

{% set snapshot_relation=ref(snapshot_name) %}

{# Make sure this is the actual name of your target in prod #}
{% if target.name != 'prod' %}

{# Change this part based on how you name things in prod #}
{% set prod_snapshot_relation = adapter.get_relation(
      database=snapshot_relation.database,
      schema='snapshots',
      identifier=snapshot_relation.identifier
) %}

{% endif %}

{#
Use an or operator to handle:
1. the case where the prod version has not yet been created
2. the case where we are in prod
#}

{{ return(prod_snapshot_relation or snapshot_relation) }}

{% endmacro %}

```
Et voilà! In both prod and dev, my model will select from:
```
select * from analytics.analytics.orders_snapshot
```
And my documentation looks right!

If you are attempting to run SlimCI, as of writing, the generate_database_name and generate_schema_name **within** the snapshot configuration will mark these files as state: modified.

Environment awareness logic for snapshots (and perhaps other models, though I've not tested that) must live within dbt_project.yml in order to not trigger files as modified when comparing across targets (i.e. target == prod and target == ci)

While I did utilize the snapshots macro listed here to have dev point to prod snapshots, this did not solve the issue I was hoping to solve (slimCI running all snapshots in their own temporary schema, which then runs ever child model if using state:modified+)

I wanted to avoid snapshots being deployed into default_schema (`target.schema`), which in my case would be `MRT_schema` in deployment and `USER_schema` in development. Instead, I wanted it to be deployed into `INT_schema`, but still be built in `USER_schema` in development. 

And without Jinja being nessecary (!) this was done as following: 

**SETUP**
1. First make two different folders inside snapshot, to group snapshots whether they were to be publicly available in the organization (hence `deployed`), or still only in development (hence `dev_only`). 
![image|315x93](upload://rYz7JEVp5ehpQGLO1Cp2EgAxr9m.png)

2. Go into `dbt_project.yml` and edit the code to the following: 
```
snapshots:
  <project_name>:
    deployed: 
      +target_schema: INT_schema
    dev_only:
      +target_schema: target.schema  # user schema 
```

**USE**:
- When developing the snapshot and wanting it to be for developing uses only, leave the `snapshot.sql` in `dev_only`.
- When wanting to publish the dataset, so others in the organization may use it - but still in a custom schema, move the file into `deployed`.

This gives both the flexibility and control during both dev and production.",6

The objectives are to increase performance and facilitate end users analytics queries. Let's also assume each event row belongs to an event type and that we have time series data.

What are the best practices regarding such an endeavor and the common pitfall to avoid?",1
1096,"what-are-the-best-practices-to-partition-big-tables-in-redshift","Hi Guillaume!

Let's call this idea ""soft-partitioning"" - this would be when instead of keeping all rows for an entity in one table, you split the table into ""partitions"" and create a view to union them together so that they can be queried as a single entity. In some databases, partitioning is supported natively, but in Redshift that is not the case. 

In the example you've provided, let's start by imagining that all event types have the same set of columns, and any extra data has been normalized into other tables, and you're okay with keeping those per-event fields outside of the soft-partitioned table.

In that case, we would have a set of tables (let's call them `a,b,...,z`) containing `m` columns, which can be accessed like:

```sql
SELECT shared_col_1, shared_col_2, ... shared_col_m
FROM a
```

The main question we need to answer in this case is ""how do we partition"", aka what do a, b, c, etc represent?

Well, this really depends on your data-generating-process, and your usage pattern. Unfortunately, making an informed table optimization decision **also** requires going down some pretty deep rabbit holes about Redshift, so let's dive right in.


### Interlude: Redshift Architecture
At the file-system level, Redshift logically subdivides tables into columns, and columns are logically divided into sorted and unsorted regions, and these column-regions are divided along a dist-key and distributed among the [slices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_high_level_system_architecture.html) of the cluster and split up into 1MB `blocks` of compressed data. When redshift performs a read, it checks the min/max values _per block_, and determines which block(s) can be skipped.  

Not only that, these blocks are immutable. if a single value in a block changes, the whole block is invalidated. so, if a `last_name` column is updated for a person who changed their name, the 1MB block containing that `last_name` value is marked as invalid (""tombstoned"" in Redshift parlance) and a new block is created, and this block-replacement happens, implicitly, within a transaction. 

Not only that, if the data was sorted before, it's possible that the update caused the block to become unsorted (such as when updating a sortkey column). Now your table needs to be vacuumed and analyzed again. If it's a big table, then you may be facing an unfortunate trade off between read performance for that table on one hand and table-write-availability and cluster performance on the other. Vacuums are expensive, and they prevent writes on the target table while the vacuum is writing. 

Similar considerations should be taken for inserts - you choose the ""order"" of your data, and if possible, you want to insert ""in order"" as often as possible to avoid data being written to the blocks in the unsorted region - the less sorted your data is, the higher the percentage of data that needs to be scanned to complete your query. Again, on a big table, we care about that!

As a final topic in this Redshift architecture deep dive, let's consider how redshift deals with views of unioned tables. 

it is the case that when you have a view defined like

```sql
CREATE VIEW breakfast_events AS

SELECT 'make coffee' AS event_type, coffee_events.* FROM coffee_events

UNION ALL

SELECT 'make eggs' AS event_type, eggs_events.* FROM eggs_events

UNION ALL 

... etc
```

Then Redshift's **query planner** ""knows"" that if you select from that view `WHERE event_type = 'make eggs'` that it does not actually need to execute the view as written -- it doesn't even need to look at block statistics to know, with total certainty, that `'make eggs'` events come from the UNION'ed subqueries for which the event_type was hardcoded to `'make eggs'`. If we did _not_ hardcode this value (such as if event_type were pulled from the underlying table), then redshift would need to depend on its statistics or possibly scan all data to make that determination. 

So, when we hardcode the ""partition"" value into the subqueries for this view, we give redshift's planner perfect information to act on. 


## Putting it together
So, with that information, we can combine our knowledge of Redshift with our understanding of the problem domain.

### Date-based partitioning: A Classic
Traditionally, data is partitioned into sets of ""hot"" and ""cold"" tables. In most circumstances, this means monthly partitions, because most arriving events will be from the last month or two, and anything else is a freak occurrence or is a planned backfill. It's a solid strategy for keeping your data in sort order. In particular, even if you have `event_type` in your data, one could argue that it's rare to look at just one event over a very long period of time - usually you look at a `session` and all events associated with it. For most systems, `session`s last span less than 24 hours more than 99% of the time. Therefore, partitioning your data by month makes a decent amount of sense!

But if the data is really large, you might not actually have enough granularity for ""highly selective"" scans -- depending on the sort order of the blocks within a partition, you might not skip any blocks at all, and the scan could still be slow, because for any growing product, this month and last month will have many more events than most prior months, especially if growth is exponential.  So let's say in order to ensure selectivity, we make the first sortkey column of the table `event_time`. 

But wait, what if we want to filter on a specific event_type? We're going to have to do a full scan of all partitions within the specified date range. if you are _looking_ for a certain event, you may not know the exact time, and could be stuck doing full scans of multiple partitions. 

You could use event_type as the first sortkey column, but the you may lose selectivity on event-agnostic queries. Does that matter? _It depends._ if you have enormous data, such that each event contains many blocks, then making event_time a secondary sortkey could still provide decent selectivity. But that would likely have to be on the order of 10s of millions of events per event type to see appreciable benefit. If you've got that, then try it!


## categorical partitioning - worth considering
If instead, you partitioned by `event_type`, you can then sort your data by event_time without any guilt. on any time-selective query (`event_time between x and y`), you'll get good block selectivity as long as the event_type has a lot of data (and if an event type doesn't have a lot of data, frankly, you don't really have a scale challenge for that event type, so it is moot - if that event type grows, then the date range per block will tighten, and selectivity will improve). 

Furthermore, if an event arrives late, it goes into a dedicated unsorted region _for that event_ -- you're less likely to receive a similar benefit in date based partitioning, especially if the sortkey is event type --- in that case, basically all data will arrive out of sort order, and so every partition will need to be frequently vacuumed. You'd have to choose between offering good event_type selectivity on one hand, and frequently vacuuming on the other. No such trade-off exists for categorical partitioning with a time based sortkey.

In other words, more needs to go right for classic date based partitioning to provide more benefits.


## Extending the problem: varying data structure across categories

So far, we assumed that all events have the exact same fields. But that often is not true. What if, as before, each table has `m` shared columns, but also some varying number of event specific extra columns? let's express those using a notation like `extra_col_1, ... extra_col_n_<table>` such that table `a` has `n_a` extra columns, and table z has `n_z` extra columns. 

Another challenge is that those extra columns don't represent the same things. In snowflake or bigquery the best approach is to pack those into a variant (semistructured) column for the columns that don't match and call it a day. 

In redshift you might get away with json strings if the number of extra attributes is small and sparse, but it just isn't the redshift way. 

Nor would it be great to just add every extra column to each table -- you'd have `m + n_a + n_b + ... + n_z` columns, which could get large quickly -- remember, each column is allocated at least one block per slice, and on a cluster with hundreds of slices, you could easily allocate tens or hundreds of gigabytes to completely empty columns. 

*But storage is cheap on RA3 nodes* - that's true, but there is a performance cost -- those blocks still need to be allocated and written to disk, even if they're empty. adding tens or hundreds of sparse columns can significantly impact write performance. For that reason, it's worth considering another option.

### ""virtual"" columns
Remember how the word ""virtual"" was cool in the 90's? I have news for you, virtual is _still_ cool. Since we're going to wrap the union-of-tables in a view, the tables don't **actually** need to each have all the same columns -- you can hardcode them as null in the view definition for the tables which don't have the particular columns in question.

#### Example 
Let's continue with the notation from earlier: for events `a,b,c,...,z`, there would be corresponding tables `a,b,c,...z`, and each table can be said to have `m` shared columns and `n_<table>` extra columns (eg `n_a, n_b,...`). 

So, they'd be `UNION`'ed like:
```sql
SELECT 
​
	a.shared_col_1, a.shared_col_2,...a.shared_col_m,
​
	a.a_extra_col_1, a_extra_col_2, ... a_extra_col_n_a, 
​
	NULL AS b_extra_col_1, NULL AS b_extra_col_2,..., z_extra_col_n_z
FROM a
​
UNION ALL 
​
SELECT 
	b.shared_col_1, b.shared_col_2, ..., b.shared_col_m,
​
	NULL AS a_extra_col_1, NULL AS a_extra_col_2, ... a_extra_col_a_z,
​
	b.extra_col_1, b.extra_col_2, ..., b.extra_col_n_b,
​
	NULL AS c_extra_col_1, NULL AS c_extra_col_2, ..., NULL AS z_extra_col_n_z
FROM b
​
UNION ALL
​
... /* union tables c through x */
​
UNION ALL
​
SELECT z.shared_col_1, z.shared_col_2, ..., z.shared_col_m,
​
NULL AS a_extra_col_1, a_extra_col_2, ... x_extra_col_n_x,
​
z.z_extra_col_1, z.z_extra_col_2, ..., z.z_extra_col_n_z
FROM z
```

^That's how I'd do it. There are still some open questions, which I'll briefly touch on.

## That seems like a pain to implement..
yes. You'll definitely want a macro for this. I've said it before that in DBT, union macros are easy, but I'd find myself swallowing my words in implementing this. It's not extremely complicated, but it's not trivial.

What will you need above and beyond the standard loop over the table list? 

the `adapter` object has methods to get all the columns of a table. if you do this for all tables, you can:  
* convert the lists into sets, and the intersect all of them to get the set of shared columns. 
* take the set of shared columns and perform a set difference from each of the column sets to get the sets of extra columns per event type
* use `adapter` to get the data types of the extra columns -- this is (or at least once was) necessary because redshift NULL values are varchar by default -- the hardcoded nulls (eg `NULL AS a_extra_col_1`) you need to cast them to the correct type, so you'll need to pull all the data types and match them to the generated lists of extra columns
* do some complicated looping to insert the non-null extra columns in the right place (for tables b to x, the extra columns will sit somewhere in the middle of the column list) 


## What about distkeys?
well, that's kind of a different question! I'll always answer *""what should my distkey be""* with *""what are you joining to?""*.  Usually, events are joined to users. At this point, I'd recommend checking the skew of the proposed distkey. That's a tutorial in and of itself so I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader. But if you aren't going to be consistently joining to one table, or if the skew of the join column is highly skewed, use DISTSTYLE EVEN and call it a day!


...

Whew okay that's my answer.  Happy Trails!

1110,"using-dbt-snowflake-shares","# How Drizly is improving collaboration with external partners using dbt & Snowflake shares

Drizly is the leader in alcohol e-commerce. We partner with local retailers so you can shop the large selection of beer, wine and liquor across stores, right from your phone, and get it delivered in under 60 minutes. Along with providing this service, we strategically partner with alcohol brands and suppliers. These include companies like ABI, who own brands such as Bud Light, Budweiser, and Michelob, or Diageo, who owns many liquor brands such as Casamigos, Bulleit, and Smirnoff. These partners are interested in Drizly's unique data set for many reasons. It can be used to segment marketing campaigns, fix inventory gaps, and just create a better overall customer experience.

We used to share this data via adhoc SFTP jobs. This wasn't scalable (each new partner required a lot of work), and was tedious to get right, often resulting in chain emails with 50+ messages to get the details right.

Since migrating to Snowflake, we started leveraging their [Data Sharing](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro.html) features to share data with our suppliers securely, and in a scalable way.

I recently spoke about this on an Office Hours ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IrtPg9eBHw68gn-O3-wqvbYygGgy8ZjBfdeEOGT7Yn0/edit#slide=id.g745995065c_0_66)):

[https://youtu.be/SJ-nuPkri-A](https://youtu.be/SJ-nuPkri-A)

This has removed an enormous headache for us while creating a ton of value for our partners. Our approach will be useful for just about any business that works with external partners:

- SaaS companies who want to provide data to their customers (e.g. an HR software company that wants to enable customers to query their own data)
- Marketplaces / platforms that want to share data with their suppliers, who often can't get this data themselves
- Organizations that have strategic partnerships and want to share data securely

# Creating a share manually

The below SQL gives you an idea of how to create a share manually.

```sql
create or replace share sales_s;

alter share sales_s add accounts=xy12345;

grant usage on database analytics to share sales_s;

create schema if not exists sharing;

create secure view analytics.sharing.sales as (
  select ...
);

grant usage on schema analytics.sharing to share sales_s;

grant select on view analytics.sharing.sales to share sales_s;
```

There's a few things to note about shares:

- Only the `accountadmin` role can run a `create share` command
- When sharing a view, it must be a `secure` view

And for our use case, we had a few extra considerations:

- We only want to share prod data, not dev ones
- Suppliers must *only* be able to read their own data

But manually creating shares was not enough. Instead, we chose to use dbt for this process because:

- By version controlling our code, we implement extra security around what data gets shared and with which account
- By using dbt hooks to run this code, this process becomes scalable — the effort to add one (or a dozen!) new suppliers is minimal.

So, on to dbt!

# Using dbt to automate this process

## Step 1: Create reader accounts

Create a [reader account](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro.html) for a supplier so they can login to Snowflake. We use terraform to automate and version control this process.

## Step 2: Map internal supplier IDs to Snowflake accounts IDs

Use a [seed](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/seeds/) for this. This means the list of accounts are version controlled, reducing the risk of any mistakes happening.

`seeds/supplier_share_access_rules.csv`

```csv
company_id,account_id
4,FKA85312
5,UVZ23642
6,RPX31467
```


## Step 3: Create the share

We use a [pre-hook](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/pre-hook) to do this. To make things tidier (and so that we could re-use it across multiple  models),  we bundled the code into a macro.

```sql
models:
  sharing:
    pre-hook:
      - ""{{ create_share('drizlys_share', ['FKA85312', 'UVZ23642', 'RPX31467'] }}""
```

Our macro also includes logic to make sure this only runs in prod (leveraging the [target variable](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/writing-code-in-dbt/jinja-context/target/)). And the SQL uses the `if not exists` syntax to avoid errors.

```sql
-- macros/create_share.sql
{% macro create_share(share_name, accounts) %}
  {% if target.name == ""prod"" %}

    {% set sql %}
      CREATE SHARE IF NOT EXISTS {{ share_name }};
      GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE {{ target.database }} TO SHARE {{ share_name }};

      {% for account in accounts %}
        ALTER SHARE {{ share_name }} ADD ACCOUNTS = {{ account }};
      {% endfor %}

    {% endset %}

    {% set table = run_query(sql) %}

  {% endif %}

{% endmacro %}

```

## Step 4: Create the view to be shared

We only want suppliers to be able to see their own data. Rather than create a model for each supplier that we share separately, we use Snowflake's [current_account()](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/current_account.html) function to create a filter, joining back to our seed file to make sure we are filtering correctly.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM {{ ref('store_order_items_supplier_vw') }}
WHERE company_id IN (SELECT company_id
                      FROM {{ ref('supplier_share_access_rules') }}
                      WHERE UPPER(account_id) = CURRENT_ACCOUNT())
```

## Step 5: Share the view

Use a [post-hook](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/post-hook/) to grant the share. Again, we used a macro here.

```sql

{{ config(
  materialized='view'
  secure=true,
  post_hook=""{{ share_view ('SHARING', 'SHARED_STORE_ORDER_ITEMS_VW', 'drizly_share' }}""
) }}
```

Again, this only runs in prod!

```sql
{% macro share_view(view_schema, view_name, share_name) %}
  {% if target.name == ""prod"" %}

    {% set sql %}
      GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA {{ target.database }}.{{ view_schema }} TO SHARE {{ share_name }};
      GRANT SELECT ON TABLE {{ target.database }}.{{ view_schema}}.{{ view_name }} TO SHARE {{ share_name }}
    {% endset %}

    {% set table = run_query(sql) %}

  {% endif %}

{% endmacro %}
```

## Step 6: Relax 😌

And that's it! Next time you `dbt run` in prod, the shares will be successfully created!

Once this is setup, adding a new supplier only takes a few minutes — we just add them to our dbt project and terraform config, and everything gets created as expected.

## Future improvements

We're pretty happy with this process so far. From here, the only thing we are going to tweak is setting up [resource monitors](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/resource-monitors.html) within our Terraform config to help control cost, since reader account credits are charged to our account. If you'd like to follow the issue thats open with terraform regarding resource monitors, you can find that [here](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/145).",1

Unfortunately, various hosted docker solutions (and various docker-providing Linux distros!) have their own silly and obscure bugs around returning ENOSYS (the underlying message here) in various places, so it's hard to say exactly what is going on or how you could fix it. A sampling from a quick search:

* If you're on Windows, it's possibly this bug: https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5955
* If you're on GCE, it could be this: https://stackoverflow.com/q/59938948/11262881
* If you're on Azure, this could be it: https://stackoverflow.com/q/51616058/11262881

And I know Ubuntu in the 14.04 era used to return ENOSYS all the time for filesystem reasons. I'm sure that's improved, but older Linux distributions/docker versions are more likely to ENOSYS.",2

As discussed in the dbt Slack I am moving this to the discourse:
I have a very general question for you and it is something i’ve been wondering a lot recently. 
According to classical business intelligence theory a Data Warehouse should include some kind of transformation/data modelling like normalization, star-/snowflake-/galaxy- and/or data vault schema. Often you hear a mixture of some of those system being applied, most commonly normalization or data vault and then e.g. a star schema for end user access to the data via the BI Tool…

However, I feel like this is something mostly huge corporations are doing as the need for such a transformation is much higher because of much bigger data / way more different data sources / a much bigger data analysis department and other reasons.

To me it seems as if a lot of “younger” companies that don’t have that much data / different sources / not as many data people are skipping these classical transformations or use it only partly (e.g. when giving access to colleagues transform the data from raw to star schema right away).
I am wondering now… is this something that is actually happening? Or are most of you actually following that “classical” way? :thinking: 

How are you approaching that? Are you using these modelling techniques in your company? And if so how does your data stack look like (like how many data people, how many sources, small or big data - of course only if you are happy to share it :slightly_smiling_face: )

I would be very interested in getting an idea about how other companies are approaching this and how commonly people are following the standard way or deviate from it - looking forward to your experiences!

PS: I know that there is already a great discussion about Kimball modeling here: https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/is-kimball-dimensional-modeling-still-relevant-in-a-modern-data-warehouse/225/6 . However I am more interested in how people are actually setting up their warehouses in their companies and what factors are influencing which decisions. Also I am not necessarily talking about Kimball only.

Thanks in advance :slight_smile:

1128,"data-modeling-approaches-in-modern-data-times","Re-posting my reply from the Slack:

Really good question. My thinking is that these schemas can be useful, but should only be used  *if they are useful to you*, not just because it’s what people usually do.

For example, at Zearn, we use a snowflake-ish schema, but it’s by necessity. In our prod db, we have several large event tables, and several of our user-level dimension tables have different ways of joining to other tables depending on what kind of user you are looking at. In Redshift, doing all those joins would be really slow.

Creating a snowflake schema with dbt allows us to combine all our event tables into one and take advantage of Redshift’s dist/sort keys to make joins to dimensions work well. So it works well for us. But if you don’t get some kind of defined benefit from it (e.g. speed, ease of understanding the tables, etc.), it doesn’t seem like a good idea.

For context, we have one data person (me) and only one data source we do this for (our production database). Our events tables are in the low billions of rows range, with some dimension tables in the millions of rows.",2
1128,"data-modeling-approaches-in-modern-data-times","At thriftbooks we kind of have our data in three layers:
1. Raw data. Atomic events and assorted data at various levels of tidiness (i.e. not super tidy for human consumption)
2. Normalized analytics tables from that random disorganized data - this allows the engineers to keep things organized, sanitized, named correctly, column orders right. Without duplicating data.
3. De-normalized tables created from the normalized tables to allow for easy human consumption without having to join. With the de-normalization comes some duplication. There is a small number of these tables - 10 or so - that have the ability to answer 99% of people's questions.

I don't know what the different methodologies are for data warehousing. I've heard of Kimball and others, but never really looked into them. We've found our process to be easy for our engineers to work with, easy for our customers to query, and efficient for our data engine (Snowflake at this time) to process.",3
1128,"data-modeling-approaches-in-modern-data-times","@trevor that's a neat approach. Do you have an example of what might be in each of the three layers? I am trying to wrap my head around whether/when something like that would be useful for us.",4
1128,"data-modeling-approaches-in-modern-data-times","This is an excellent question.  I work for a large non-profit and we have been grappling with this question as we engage in a re-design of our data warehouse as we move to the cloud.  We have settled on:
1. An Extract process to take source data from sources and dump it raw into cloud storage.  We call this our data lake.
2. A secondary Extract process to load from cloud storage into our cloud data warehouse.
3. Kimball Star Schema Modeling.  We do this primarily to reduce complexity so we can have a layer where the data is easy to understand.  This reduces long term technical debt.
4. Some of our analytical tools can use the star schema directly, and we are done.  Other analytical tools need a wide table that exposes hundreds of columns.  We call this a ""context"", and we define it as a fact table with all possible dimension tables joined together into one wide table.

We are in the process of creating this next generation data warehouse.  We have implented all of the technical pieces, and we are now in our implementation stage where we are modeling our tables and building it step by step.  Time will tell how well it works, but we already see value.",5
1128,"data-modeling-approaches-in-modern-data-times","Thanks for sharing that @Craig and @trevor 
I am wondering: Is the Kimball Star Schema the layer only non-analytics people and the tools are using or are most of the data analysts also directly accessing that star schema?
One thing which is puzzling me is that for data analysts (or bi managers or analytics engineers, however you would call them) isn't there a lot of data exploration involved? Especially investigating into topics or creating reports that are not yet accessible via the star schema?
I have the same question for creating a normalized table layer. Do you try to involve all the data you get from the start and normalize it although there is no clear goal to use it yet or do you add new tables/columns only once they are needed?",6
1128,"data-modeling-approaches-in-modern-data-times","Hi @drege! Good questions. 

**Do you try to involve all the data you get from the start and normalize it although there is no clear goal to use it yet or do you add new tables/columns only once they are needed?**

I've been at ThriftBooks for over 8 years - as a developer, dev manager, director, and VP. I've seen the types of questions people are asking for a long time, so I have a good sense for what data to include and what data to not include. But generally, if the data fits along the grain and might answer a question, I include it. Adding an extra column to a columnar database is not a big deal. If you don't add it, people won't be able to see it. If you do add it, maybe nobody will want it and it'll just clutter things up. I tend to err on the explorability side of things. I'd rather give them the opportunity to see that a field is available and have them decide to not use it than to not show it to them.

**Isn’t there a lot of data exploration involved? Especially investigating into topics or creating reports that are not yet accessible via the star schema?**

We tell our analysts if there's anything they need, let us know and we'll add it as quickly as possible. If there's a question they want answered, and the data isn't in the modeled tables, and we have it in our raw data, we add it usually by the next day. Our models are pretty comprehensive because of this. At the beginning, we were adding a lot of tables. Now though, we add or modify something a few times a week.",7
1128,"data-modeling-approaches-in-modern-data-times","Also interesting that @Craig uses both star schema and wide, de-normalized tables. I think if you can build one, it's easy to build the other. If you have a star schema, you just join up all the facts and dimensions and you've got a wide de-normalized table. If you have a wide de-normalized table, you just separate out the facts from the dimensions and you're done. The reason we go w/ the wide de-normalized tables is b/c they are faster to query in Snowflake. A single massive table with billions of rows can be queried pretty easily w/ an extra-small, but when we started joining tables together, unless they had clustering keys the performance was not as good. Clustering keys cost money to maintain, and larger warehouses cost money to run. So the big table works for us.",8
1128,"data-modeling-approaches-in-modern-data-times","@Craig curious how this journey has gone a year in. We are in the process of building out our analytics stack at my company and I've gone back and forth with this. I haven't found much material on how this is being implemented, use cases, etc.",9
1128,"data-modeling-approaches-in-modern-data-times","Reading this as part of dbt onboarding and wanted to share a ""how we did it"" from a 2-3 person Analytics Engineering team responsible for delivering data to both in-house stakeholders and client-facing reporting. I'd say maybe mid-sized data on reverse supply chain and recommerce (~100M rows of units through the system)

Notably, we also had a number of (Snowflake) SQL power users in our data stakeholder group, including people on the Ops team on warehouse floors, so intuitive navigation in the db was a high priority in our modeling. 

We settled on a schema per business entity (e.g. unit) and then four types of tables:

* `<entity>_details`: all the immutable information about the entity (e.g. `unit_details` would have things like client_id and created_timestamp)
* `<entity>_current`: everything in the `_details` model, plus the current value of any mutable fields (e.g. `status` or `warehouse_location`)
* `<entity>_aggregates`: everything in the `_current` model, plus any aggregates from other entities (e.g. `storage_location_aggregates` had a `unit_count` based on `unit_current.storage_location`)
* Any number of `<entity>_<event>` tables, comparable to `fact` tables, where we preserved the event stream of anything that could impact each entity (e.g. `unit_received`, `unit_sorted`, `unit_fulfilled`).

While there's obviously some cruftiness to building table, table-plus, and table-plus-plus, we found this was an acceptable amount of duplication to give users the ability to join to a single table depending on the type of field they needed (i.e. if they just needed `status`, they could stop at `_current` rather than `aggregates`).  That said, dbt's style guide has suggested it might have been better to JUST surface events and `_aggregates` in the `marts` pattern.

Still, even this approach was a huge improvement from just-in-time query builds.",10
1128,"data-modeling-approaches-in-modern-data-times","Hi Drege,

I think it depends on our actual requirements: the big corporations tend to use more sophisticated designs such as Data Vault because they have sophisticated requirements (security, privacy, as in GDPR, data governance, agile extension, multi-cloud, etc.). 

However, there is a misconception about Data Vault: we sometimes hear that DV is too complicated for small use cases, but that's actually not true: if you have low requirements, DV keeps simple as well. But it also has a lot of solutions for more advanced scenarios, but every solution will add something to the resulting model. So the model looks (and becomes) more complicated, but the underlying reason is actually that your requirements are complicated and that is reflected by the resulting solution. 

One of our clients gave me excellent feedback on this: he was involved in a non-Data Vault project and told me that they were actually super fast in delivering something. However, it only worked for a while until the requirements increased and the solution more or less broke (because it wasn't extensible). 

Everyone knows that the data volume , velocity increases over time. So I guess that everybody agrees that the solutions must scale in this regard. However, its also true that the requirements how we process data increase over time (think about the introduction of GDPR in Europe, which was a steep step for many). So a solution should also scale in regards to the requirements IMHO. 

Hope that helps a bit,

I’m after a book or a few long and in-depth blog posts to explain the pros and cons of different models so that I can then make informed decisions given a particular use case. I've previously enjoyed Martin Fowler's lengthy posts on software architecture, but he hasn't done much on data architecture (and [what is there](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html) is laden with buzzwords and light on technical detail for my liking).

I know The DW Toolkit by Kimball would be a standard reference, but following on from the discussion on [this discourse post](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/is-kimball-dimensional-modeling-still-relevant-in-a-modern-data-warehouse/225/4) it seems like there is some debate about its relevance in the MPP database age (although it still seems like a good starting point to me).

Can anyone recommend any  **favourite DW design books**? Or books / long blog posts in general that are must-reads for a technical data lead?

In return, I recommend my favourite technical data architecture book, [Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppman](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321#customerReviews), which is AMAZING as a foundation for understanding and combining all kinds of different data systems.",1

* Sean C: I've found [Agile Data Warehouse Design](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Data-Warehouse-Design-Collaborative/dp/0956817203) is a good book for this.

1129,"dw-design-which-books-should-i-read-in-2020","There was some more discussion on the original Slack thread, Dave says:

>Kimball is still relevant, it's also worth learning about Inmon and about Data Vault and plain old transactional database modelling. The core parts of Kimball are
> 1) semantic layer - converting technical naming into business-aligned naming.
> 2) De-normalizing as appropriate
> 3) laser focus on business perspective
>
> What I don't think is so useful is when people read all the technical parts and develop a fixation on the perfect one-size-fits-all-queries star/snowflake schema. There's some context around when a lot of that was written, mainly to do with the limitations of database technology. Much of it is still relevant, the laws of physics haven't changed, but some things can be relaxed now.
> For example it's not such a big deal to store multiple redundant copies of denormalized tables that are aggregated in different ways or at different granularities. Especially with cloud based systems like Redshift Spectrum, Athena, Snowflake etc storing the data on blob storage is virtually unlimited and relatively cheap.
> I also think it is valuable to realise that if you do create a one-size-fits-all data warehouse then it will not be optimised for any particular use-case. It will be a bit lowest-common-denominator. You can spend months and months trying to build something ""perfect"" like that and then discover the 5 -10 really important use cases don't run quickly at all.
> One place where dim / fact tables can clash with MPP architecture is that you really want to avoid shuffling between nodes. It's always going to be faster to have zero joins in a query because a single table can be partitioned across nodes and queries parallelised easily... assuming queries use predicates that are in sympathy with the partitioning strategy. That said, small dimension tables can be stored redundantly in full, on each node, with larger fact tables partitioned across multiple nodes. Co-located (merge) joins are faster, but not as fast as no joins. And as soon as you get complex subqueries then the query engine no longer has sorting guarantees (and hence merge joins) and colocation can't be relied on either.
> What remains is the laser focus on the business requirements. An architecture that is a bit messy and organic, but has some denormalized datamart-style tables is going to be more useful more quickly than a full blown data warehouse.
> If you do have extensive data lineage and auditing requirements, then certainly using Data Vault as an intermediary storage will be well worth the additional development time required.
> Ultimately the best thing you can do is equip yourself with knowledge of all the different approaches and use the ones that are relevant, disregarding the dogma.

To which Jose followed up:

> I absolutely agree with everything in your comment Dave. To be honest, the technology has advanced a lot since these data warehouse designs methodologies were created. So many people tend to either ignore them completely (so there's a risk of not having a proper design for a company wide data warehouse that covers the requirements from all departments) or they say the new design paradigms focus only on the technical side and don't go in enough detail over the business requirements so they think they have to follow every single Kimball/Inmon detail. It's really important to understand the methodologies and the why of them to make proper decisions",4
1129,"dw-design-which-books-should-i-read-in-2020","Hi Fabrice,

thanks for the praise :slight_smile: 

There is some background for the book - when we wrote it, we wanted to address two target audiences: the professional DWH developer and the beginners, probably sitting in college and learning data warehousing for the first time (with Data Vault 2.0). So I believe / hope its a good starting point for many youngsters.

From our experience, dbt works great with Data Vault 2.0, especially if you follow the ""data-driven"" approach (due to the flexibility of Data Vault, there are many approaches to the modelling style). We have made great experience with DV & dbt at clients of varying scale.

1274,"how-do-you-deal-with-missing-dimensions-for-foreign-keys","Hi,

What's the best practice in DBT for dealing with missing dimensions for foreign keys?

For example, I have a fact_orders that contains a foreign key to a dim_funnel. The rows in dim_funnel have to be maintained manually, so it can frequently happen that orders happen on a funnel, but the dimension row for the funnel hasn't been added yet.

In a traditional DWH model we would include a special row like ""Missing Funnel"" with a -1 key for example. And then in the fact table query we would check if the correct foreign key exists in the dimension table and if not set it it to -1.

A similar situation can happen when dimension records are deleted, but the facts referencing it are kept.

I guess when generating the fact table, I could do a join on the dimension to check if the key is there, but this prevents one of primary benefits of using hash keys-- being able to load dimensions and facts in parallel.

So I am just wondering how you guys are handling such a situation.

Thanks, Kim",1
1274,"how-do-you-deal-with-missing-dimensions-for-foreign-keys","We still create a ""-1"" ""Unknown"" row in our dimensions. Although it's not actually ""-1"" literally, it's the hash of ""-1"". And then we have a variable in our dbt_project.yml file like this:

`  unknown_key: ""CAST(FARM_FINGERPRINT('-1') AS INT64)""`

Then when we build our fact tables and need to populate the keys to join to the dimension tables, we do something like this: 

	COALESCE(pers.person_key, {{ var('unknown_key') }} ) AS person_key,

I never really thought of one of the primary benefits of hash keys as being able to load dimensions and facts in parallel per se.",2

1278,"trigger-a-dbt-cloud-job-on-merging-to-master-branch","## Background

dbt Cloud is an excellent service and great value, providing an easy way to manage scheduled dbt jobs. As well as scheduling, it allows for Webhooks to be used so that a job can be triggered to run on a pull request (PR) to a branch specified in your dbt Cloud deployment environment. Jobs triggered via the webhook will be run against a new schema in your datawarehouse that will be cleaned up at the end of the run. Great for testing, but what about running a real production job?

In addition to schedules and webhooks, dbt Cloud also provides an API for triggering runs, which you can use to run a job that will use the regular schema(s) you use for jobs. 

## Why?
The main reason you might want to do this is to minimize how often a job runs that consists entirely of views, or to generate the dbt docs. On a target warehouse like Snowflake, this could mean a virtual warehouse spends less time on and more time in suspended mode, where you don't have to pay for it. The alternative, recreating view definitions on a schedule, is pointless busywork given dbt Cloud jobs usually run only from the master branch and the only time the views could possibly change is when new code is merged to the master branch.

I will illustrate two alternative ways to trigger a dbt Cloud job to run *on merge to master branch* using CI tools, firstly with **Github Actions** and then with **CircleCI**. 

The approach taken here could be adapted for use with other CI tools, and should work with Git repository hosts other than Github such as Gitlab or Bitbucket, although I haven't tested any of those.

## dbt Cloud
1. Create or open an existing dbt Cloud job

Here you would normally set up a Schedule or Webhook. There is a section for ""API"", but nothing needs to be done here, it just provides a link to the docs and a basic POST example. Take note of your account ID and job ID, at this point, those IDs should be obvious in your webbrowser's URI.


2. Get your dbt API key

Open your ""My Account"" settings and go to ""API Access"", copy the API Key, you will need it later for either solution.


## Github Actions
_Use these instructions with Github Actions, for CircleCI skip to the next section_ 

1. Log in to GitHub and open your dbt repository

2. Click on ""Settings"" and then ""Secrets""

3. Add a github secret called `DBTCLOUDAPIKEY` paste in your dbt cloud API key that you copied earlier

4. Add a new github actions workflow

Contents of github/workflows/main.yml file:
  * You will need to replace the `<GOES HERE>` parts with your dbt account_id and job_id
```
name: Trigger dbt cloud job to prep views and build docs
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  prep:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Run dbt cloud job
      run: |
        RESPONSE=$(curl -v -H ""Authorization:Token ${{ secrets.DBTCLOUDAPIKEY }}"" -H ""Content-Type:application/json"" -d '{""cause"":""Triggered by Github Actions"",""git_branch"":""master""}' https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/v2/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID_GOES_HERE>/jobs/<JOB_ID_GOES_HERE>/run/)
        STATUSCODE=$(echo ""$RESPONSE"" | jq '.status.code')
        echo ""$RESPONSE"" | jq '.status.user_message'
        if [[ $STATUSCODE != 200 ]]; then echo ""$RESPONSE"" && bash -c ""exit 1""; fi

```

5. Ensure this is merged in to the master branch, the next time something is merged this workflow should run.

## CircleCI version
_These instructions assume you already have a CircleCI account and have it connected with your GitHub (or other) git host_ 

1. Log in to your CircleCI account
2. Open ""Projects""
3. If it is not already enabled you may need to ""Set Up Project"" for your dbt git repo
4. Add a _project_ environment variable called `DBTCLOUDAPIKEY` containing your dbt API key copied earlier

Contents of the `.circleci/config.yml` file:
  * You will need to replace the `<GOES HERE>` parts with your dbt account_id and job_id
```

              only:
                - master

jobs:
  trigger_dbt_cloud_job:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.8.1
    steps:
      - run:
          name: curl
          command: |
            RESPONSE=$(curl -v -H ""Authorization:Token ${DBTCLOUDAPIKEY}"" -H ""Content-Type:application/json"" -d '{""cause"":""Triggered by CircleCI"", ""git_branch"":""master""}' https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/v2/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID_GOES_HERE>/jobs/<JOB_ID_GOES_HERE>/run/)
            STATUSCODE=$(echo ""$RESPONSE"" | jq '.status.code')
            echo ""$RESPONSE"" | jq '.status.user_message'
            if [[ $STATUSCODE != 200 ]]; then echo ""$RESPONSE"" && bash -c ""exit 1""; fi
```
5. Ensure this is merged in to the master branch, the next time something is merged this pipeline should run


## What are those bash commands?
The script sends a request to the dbt Cloud API to run a job , and stores the reponse. The `status` attribute is extracted from that response, which will log `success!!` if everything went well, or something else if not. It then checks to see if the response code is 200 (success) and if not will log the entire response and also force a non-zero exit code so that the entire CI workflow/pipeline will fail.

## Caveats
The dbt API, Github Actions, CircleCI and other URIs mentioned here could change in the future, so refer to the relevant docs for latest up-to-date information.

The API key you use will be tied to your account, so it will be best currently for the dbt administrator to do this. It would be nice if dbt had a way to generate API Key for some _service account_ user but I am not aware of any such functionality.

### What's a blue/green deployment?
Blue-green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments. Let's take a website as an example — when you need to deploy a new version of your website, the new version is created in a separate environment. **After** the build is successful, traffic is routed to the new build. If anything goes wrong, you just don't switch over the traffic! :boom:

In analytics, we can take a similar approach:
- Maintain two separate databases (or schemas!) — for our example we're going to call them `stage` and `prod`.
- Whenever you perform your production run of dbt project, run it in the `stage` database
- Once all your tests have passed, switch out the `stage` database for the `prod` database.

Hey presto! No bad data creeping into `prod` ever :D 

### Doing this on Snowflake
1. Set up two new databases, and grant ownership of these databases to the role that runs your dbt project
```sql 
create database stage;
grant ownership on database stage to role transformer;

create database prod;
grant ownership on database prod to role transformer;

```
2. Update your dbt project to write to the `stage` database (this will mean updating either your `profiles.yml` or your connection in dbt Cloud).
3. Add an [operation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/hooks-operations#operations) to your project to swap the databases  (more on this below).
```
# macros/swap_database.sql
{% macro swap_database() %}

    {% set sql='alter database prod swap with stage' %}
    {% do run_query(sql) %}
    {{ log(""database swapped"", info=True) }}

{% endmacro %}
```
4. Add a macro to your project to override the `ref` function (more on this below)
```sql
-- Macro to override ref and to render identifiers without a database.

{% macro ref(model_name) %}

  {% do return(builtins.ref(model_name).include(database=false)) %}

{% endmacro %}

```
4. Add the step to swap the databases to your deployment process — you might end up with steps like this:
```
$ dbt run
$ dbt test
$ dbt run-operation swap_database
```
That's it! Now, if your run fails at any step, bad data won't be promoted to `prod`!

### What's this `swap` syntax?
Snowflake has a handy tool to help us out here — the `swap` syntax. It essentially performs two renames at once — you can find more info out [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-database.html) (`cmd + f` for `swap with`).

So by executing:
```sql
alter database prod swap with stage;
```
We're essentially executing these two things at the exact same time, with zero downtime:
```sql
alter database prod rename to stage;
alter database stage rename to prod;
```

### Why do I need to override `ref`?
By default, dbt resolves any `ref` function to a fully qualified object reference. This means that this:
```sql
select * from {{ ref('dim_customers') }}
```
Gets resolved to:
```sql
select * from stage.core.dim_customers
```

In Snowflake (and other databases), views are saved as queries. If the query has a reference to `stage.core.dim_customers`, we could end up with errors like this after we've done the swap:
```txt
SQL compilation error: Schema 'STAGE.CORE' does not exist or not authorized.
```
Or worse, we could be selecting from an out of date view (i.e. the one that got ""demoted"" to the `stage` database).

To get around this, we need to tell dbt: ""well ackshullllly, don't put the database name in there"". So this:
```
select * from {{ ref('dim_customers') }}
```

Should get resolved to this:
```
select * from core.dim_customers
```
Since this is a relative reference, as long as `core.dim_customers` exists in this `prod` database (which it should!), the view will work as expected.

To change the behavior of dbt, we can add our own `ref` macro. Whenever you add your own macro with the same name as a dbt macro, dbt will honor _your_ version (related: [dbt ships with a project](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/did-you-know-dbt-ships-with-its-own-project/764)).

There's a bit of magic to do with [builtins](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/builtins/) here, but the important thing is this — use the code above to get dbt to _not_ use the database name when resolving `ref` functions.

### Loom

Here's a video of me walking through this code in a sample dbt project :point_down:

1349,"performing-a-blue-green-deploy-of-your-dbt-project-on-snowflake","Claire! We've implemented the blue/green method for our dbt runs but I'm noticing a peculiar situation... 

When we run dbt into staging and then swap the schemas, the view definitions are still referencing the staging schema even after the swap macro. Is this to be expected? 

I figure if I really need to, I can run soemthing along :
`$ dbt run -m config.materialized:table --target stage`
`$ dbt run-operation swap_schema`
`$ dbt run -m config.materialized:view --target prod`",4
1349,"performing-a-blue-green-deploy-of-your-dbt-project-on-snowflake","Ok, so it sounds like you're swapping between schemas, right? Assuming the command looks something like:
```
{% macro swap_schema() %}

    {% set sql='alter schema prod swap with stage' %}
    {% do run_query(sql) %}
    {{ log(""schema swapped"", info=True) }}

{% endmacro %}
```

If that's the case, you might need to alter the `ref` function even further!

```
{% macro ref(model_name) %}
  {% do return(builtins.ref(model_name).include(database=false).include(schema=false) %}
{% endmacro %}
```

Then a model like this `customers` model:
```sql
{{ config(materialized='view') }}
select * from {{ ref('stg_customers') }}
```

Ends up compiling to this:
```sql
create view my_database.stage.customers as (
  select * from stg_customers
)
```
(Note the lack of schema prefix in the view definition)

But then you get into all kind of strange things:
- How do you get Snowflake to use the right schema when there's no schema reference in the view definition? Does Snowflake automatically search for `stg_customers` the same schema the `customers` view was created in? (I'm not sure!) Or do you have to tell anything (or anyone) that selects from these views to `use schema prod` before selecting from a view... (in which case, that's not great)
- This would probably prevent you from [using custom schemas](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas/) in the future

You _could_ implement an approach like the one you suggested, but I think it will look more like the below, since the initial command should run everything (otherwise, tables might be built on top of views that haven't been updated).
```
$ dbt run -m --target stage
$ dbt run-operation swap_schema
$ dbt run -m config.materialized:view --target prod
```

Overall, I guess I'd push back on swapping schemas here, and encourage you to think about swapping databases instead. It just feels much tidier!",5

1349,"performing-a-blue-green-deploy-of-your-dbt-project-on-snowflake","Hi All, in order to make it running in Redshift I did the following adjustments:
1) All dbt transformation is done in a schema called schema_name_stage. Thus I created a macro to create this schema if it does not exist at the beginning.
# macros/create_stage_schema.sql
{% macro create_stage_schema() %}
    {% set sql='CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS  schema_name_stagev AUTHORIZATION user' %}
    {% do run_query(sql) %}
    {{ log(""schema schema_name_stage created"", info=True) }}
{% endmacro %}
   This macro is called on on-run-start.

2) instead of swaping database I swape schemas. in redshift using the macro below: 
# macros/swap_schema.sql
{% macro swap_schema() %}
    {% set sql0='DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS schema_name_previous CASCADE' %}
    {% do run_query(sql0) %}
    {% set sql1='ALTER SCHEMA schema_name_prod RENAME TO schema_name_previous' %}
    {% do run_query(sql1) %}
    {% set sql2='ALTER SCHEMA schema_name_stage RENAME TO schema_name_prod' %}
    {% do run_query(sql2) %}
    {{ log(""schemas swapped from schema_name_stage to schema_name_prod"", info=True) }}
{% endmacro %}

3) Thus the final pipeline looks like:
3.1. dbt run
3.2. dbt test
3.3 dbt run-operation swap_schema
I only run the step 3.3 if both run and test worked using github actions.

I hope this helps others.",12

Only if it passes does it move onto audited schema.
This has saved our production data many times and works with many incremental models.

I used this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwUonA3mDg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwUonA3mDg) to set it up (it talks about BigQuery but the principles work for Redshift).

Claus was incredibly helpful in supporting me and gave me the key tip:
Take a look at the [slides](https://calogica.com/assets/wap_dbt_bigquery.pdf) (slide 26 and on) for how I proposed doing this on dbt Cloud. 
tl;dr is that you could use `var` for this instead of `target` and get the same result. So each job on dbt Cloud would pass in the relevant `var` to control the build

Therefore we pass in a --vars varaible in our dbt Cloud set-up, so our job looks like this:
1. dbt seed --vars 'audit: true'
2. dbt run --vars 'audit: true'
3. dbt test --vars 'audit: true'
4. dbt source snapshot-freshness --vars 'audit: true'
5. dbt seed
6. dbt run
7. dbt test
8. dbt source snapshot-freshness

You could then unload part/all of the unaudited schema if you want, but we find running two copies is an acceptable cost for the benefit.",13

1369,"a-partial-workaround-for-dbt-utils-star-not-working-with-ctes","Since `dbt_utils.star` doesn't work on CTEs, I've made a wee macro which solves my most common need: pulling all but a couple of columns out of a CTE in the same model file. 

To use it, you need to set the columns in your `select` statement to a variable. Then you can pass it into the CTE as normal, but also pass it into the `star_cte` macro, which will split on commas (except in brackets) and then take the last element after splitting on spaces to get the column's name/alias.

A super-contrived example:
```
with organisations as (select * from {{ ref('organisations') }}),

transformed as (
  select 
  {%- set select_columns = ""
    org_id,
    'a' b,
    dateadd(month, 1, getdate()) as some_date,
    region_name
  ""-%}

  {{select_columns}}
  from organisations
),

final as (
  select {{ star_cte(select_columns, 'transformed', except=['org_id', 'b']) }}, count(*)
  from transformed
  group by 1, 2
)

select * 
from final
```

renders to:
```
with organisations as (select * from ""reporting"".""dev_jlabes"".""organisations""),

transformed as (
  select
    org_id,
    'a' b,
    dateadd(month, 1, getdate()) as some_date,
    region_name
  
  from organisations
),

final as (
  select   
        transformed.some_date, 
        transformed.region_name, count(*)
  from transformed
  group by 1, 2
)

select * 
from final
```

The macro itself is pretty brief: 
```
{%- macro star_cte(select_columns, cte_name = '', except=[]) -%}
    
    {%- set include_cols = [] -%}
    {%- set nsp = namespace(is_in_brackets = False) %} {# ""Move the variable's scope to be global"" #}

    {%- for col in select_columns.split(',') -%}

1397,"how-do-you-manage-snowflake-privileges","Hello everyone! My company has been using Snowflake for about a year. The first few months we didn't pay a lot of attention to privileges. As more people started using Snowflake and as we started having more databases, schemas, and objects, it became difficult to manage b/c we didn't understand really how privileges in Snowflake are meant to work.

So after a little trial and error, we've come up with some hard-and-fast rules that help us keep Snowflake privileges simple and organized:
* Don't grant more than one role the ability to create objects in a single database.
* Every custom role has to eventually roll up to sysadmin.
* Never grant the database_owner roles to any other role except sysadmin.

There are lots of other things we do, but those are the most important. Some more details of how we've set things up can be found [here](https://trevorscode.com/toward-a-standard-model-for-snowflake-roles-and-privileges/). 

Our system is simple, but it works very well for us. I imagine there may come a time when it doesn't work. I'd welcome perspectives of when that might be. Perhaps others have use cases that require more sophisticated setups. What do those look like? I'm eager to learn and collect for the community some good strategies for making and keeping Snowflake privileges manageable.",1
1397,"how-do-you-manage-snowflake-privileges","Thank you for starting this convo. We had a similar experience where we learned a lot about Snowflake along the way (that's just being nice to ourselves :D )

Given this is a big topic and I'm no expert, I will just comment on your first bullet point. We think about this a bit differently. Albeit, most other things you say definitely rings true for us too.

We think about the creation/ownership of objects by schema across databsaes as well. So we have a role for general purpose loading into the RAW schemas and another role for transformation which is what dbt uses to create the objects in the STG and MART schemas.

We did this because we wanted dbt to have as little privileges as possible given we wanted as many people from the business to use dbt as possible.

This is actually similar to the design you linked. But I guess the main point is, we found it useful to have a higher privileged role ""Loader"" to be able to perform operations across databases. Then have a lower privilege role, ""Transformer"" that could own and create objects within that database.

This allows the Loader role to be much more powerful which gives a lot of flexibility upstream in the pipeline given all the various options of how data can be loaded into Snowflake.",2
1397,"how-do-you-manage-snowflake-privileges","Hi @robli, thanks for the response! If I understand correctly, you have a role `LOADER` that has the `CREATE TABLE` privilege in your raw schemas across many databases. Then your transformer probably has `SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES` in that schema. Do you have another role in your raw schemas that can create objects as well? If you do, then your transformer would have access to them and you wouldn't care who the owner was. Am I following?

I guess the only issue there would be if a human wanted to manually manage those tables - it would have to be a human that either switches between two roles, or has a composite role that encompasses the two. Which, if you follow rule 2, could just be sysadmin. I think that makes sense, especially since in the raw schemas or databases, you don't really care who created it and you don't change the schema - schema change is left up to whatever tool created it - i.e. fivetran, snowpipe loader, etc.

That makes sense. Thanks for the feedback. I'll have to think a bit about that and let it percolate a bit. Good comment.",3
1397,"how-do-you-manage-snowflake-privileges","Yeah you got it! :smiley: 

To summarise, that's right the TRANSFORMER role has read-only to future resources. Having a separate READONLY role that is granted to TRANSFORMER might be a good way to achieve it because a human can have the READONLY role as well to troubleshoot. So it's just another hop for some more flexibility.

You are right, we have a composite role. We have multiple layers of ADMIN because we don't want the lower tier ADMIN to have the powerful ""manage grants"" privilege which would allow it to transfer ownership or resources because we want a human to have this role but we don't want them transferring things around in the whole Account. Instead the lower tier ADMINs just have grants from the LOADER and TRANSFORMER which own all the tables/views/schemas they create + the READONLY. This should be plenty for a human admin (think developer).

A good outcome of this is that the LOADER role can't see the TRANSFORMER assets (i.e. STG and MARTs) which is nice because it could be a 3rd party tool/SaaS thing that has it like you mention. But if a human wants to do things, they can have the ADMIN role (and simply have the same access as owning the LOADER and TRANSFORMER's assets all in one).

Then you can have even higher tier ADMIN roles for tools like Terraform to automate all this for you.",4

Happy to answer any questions :slight_smile:",6
1397,"how-do-you-manage-snowflake-privileges","Good conversation.  A management pattern I use for Snowflake was inspired by @randy.  It introduces the concept of ""Object Access"" (OA) roles and ""Business Function"" roles.  OA roles are used for different types of access to objects.  Given a database called ""App"" you may have OA roles like this:

* OA_APP_CREATE_SCHEMA
* OA_APP_READ
* OA_APP_WRITE

These OA roles are only granted to the  ""Business Function"" (BF) roles.  Note: no users are granted to OA Roles.  Rather, a BF role represents a user group defined by a function in the business.  For example, you may have BF roles like:

* BF_APP_DATA_ENGINEER (member of the three OA roles above)
* BF_APP_DATA_ANALYST (only a member of the OA_APP_READ role granting read, but not write or create).

Users are only granted BF roles and BF roles are only granted OA roles.  Enforcing these rules is essential for a cohesive and predictable environment.  Adopting a consistent naming convention really helps to keep it all straight as well.

These concepts logically separate object access security from user access security by isolating the privileges into an OA or BF role.  The outcome is easier management of roles and privileges for the admin and fewer (or no) holes in the security architecture.",7

As for now I have been working with DBT for several months on MS SQL Server. 

First of all, have to say it is absolutely amazing, just to name a few areas: 

* SQL templates on Jinja - beautiful and promising. Saw a lot of implementations of templates for SQL: SQL + customs scripts, SQL + SQL, SQL + C# etc. - always had a feeling that it does not fit well to each other. Jinja just looks like it always has been here 
* Graph tasks (DAG) management - is what we always needed
* Environments management/CI/CD/DevOps - the ideas of DevOps in analytics started to crystallize finally into something mature
* Integrated Data Catalog - when Gartner marked data catalog as an obsolete technology https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-09-11-gartner-hype-cycle-for-data-management-positions-three-technologies-in-the-innovation-trigger-phase-in-2018 it provided a lot of confusion about the future of data catalogs at all. Now it is just exciting to see working elements of Data Catalog maturity level 4 by Deloitte `https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/de/Documents/deloitte-analytics/Deloitte_Analytics_CatalogingData-Whitepaper.pdf` 
* Open Source (and the answer to that confusing question “how to get it deployed?” - “pip install”) is a huge adoption catalyst
* And all that beauty is integrated of course together with logging, snapshots etc

The question is **why DBT is standing somehow apart from DWA (Data Warehouse automation) market although it solves a lot of tasks in the area**? 

For example, I could not find any mention of “DWA” in the forum. And digging through the DWA market for years it was quite hard to figure out that DBT is actually doing a big part of the same job. 

A few links from the DWA market:

Microsoft about DWA market 

`https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/accelerate-your-cloud-data-warehouse-with-automation-tools/`

I'm new to dbt and looking to how to better incorporate macros from `dbt_utils` into my workflow. In particular, I'm interested in using `pivot` and `get_column_values` but I have been unsuccessful so far in incorporating it in my model code with CTEs defined in the same model. Here's what I have done so far. 

I have taken the [example](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils/blob/dev/0.18.x/macros/sql/pivot.sql) from github and created a new model like so: 

-- example_model.sql

```sql
with data as (
    SELECT 'S' as size, 'red' as color
    UNION ALL SELECT 'S' ,'blue'
    UNION ALL SELECT 'S', 'red'
    UNION ALL SELECT 'M', 'red'
),
SELECT * FROM data
```
Then in another file I have the following: 
```sql
SELECT
    size,
    {{ dbt_utils.get.pivot('color', dbt_utils.get_column_values(ref('example_model'), 'color')) }}
FROM ref('example_model')
GROUP BY size
```
So far so good and this works as expected. 

However, my problem is that I don't actually want to create a new model for the first table -- it's much too small and not used for anything else (as are a lot of other temporary/CTE tables that I create). Thus, what I really want to be able to do is something like this (all in the same model file): 

```sql 
with data as (
    SELECT 'S' as size, 'red' as color
    UNION ALL SELECT 'S' ,'blue'
    UNION ALL SELECT 'S', 'red'
    UNION ALL SELECT 'M', 'red'
),
SELECT
    size,
    {{ dbt_utils.get.pivot('color', dbt_utils.get_column_values(data, 'color')) }}
FROM data
GROUP BY size
```

However, I can't seem to get this work. If I use `data` (no quotes), I get a `'data' is undefined error`; if I use `'data'` I get an `'str object' has no attribute 'database'` error. 

Thus my question is: what is the right way to refer to `data` such that I can use it in `dbt_utils.get_column_values` and without creating a new model in the process?

Thanks for your help",1
1423,"using-get-column-values-with-ctes","Hi there! Unfortunately `get_column_values` is not compatible with CTEs, as it relies on the object you pass it being a table or view in the database!



Here's some workarounds, in order of preference
1. If you're using Snowflake, use the built-in [pivot function](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/pivot.html) instead
2. Your first option works! You can keep this as a separate model! By the way, have you considered converting this to a [seed](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/seeds) instead? That way you can store these values in a CSV. 
3. You can write your own macro, `get_column_values_from_query`, which does the same thing as `get_column_values` but doesn't depend on being passed a table or view.

I've included some sample macro code, but this is a huge tradeoff — is it really worth introducing all this code when you could just have a separate model (or seed!) for the CTE? Anyway....

```
{% set data_query %}
SELECT 'S' as size, 'red' as color
UNION ALL SELECT 'S' ,'blue'
UNION ALL SELECT 'S', 'red'
UNION ALL SELECT 'M', 'red'
{% endset %}

with data as (
    {{ data_query }}
)

SELECT
    size,
    {{ dbt_utils.pivot('color', get_column_values_from_query(data_query, 'color')) }}
FROM data
GROUP BY size

```
Note that I had to `set` a value for `data_query` — earlier you were using `data` as an argument, but there wasn't a variable named `data` in the Jinja context, so it would have been evaluating to `None`.

From here, you'll need to write your own macro – here's some starter code. It works, but it isn't pretty

```
-- macros/get_column_values_from_query.sql
{% macro get_column_values_from_query(query, column) -%}

{#-- Prevent querying of db in parsing mode. This works because this macro does not create any new refs. #}
    {%- if not execute -%}
        {{ return('') }}
    {% endif %}

    {% set column_values_sql %}
    with cte as (
        {{ query }}
    )
    select
        {{ column }} as value

    from cte
    group by 1
    order by count(*) desc

    {% endset %}

    {%- set results = run_query(column_values_sql) %}
    {{ log(results, info=True) }}
    {% set results_list = results.columns[0].values() %}

    {{ log(results_list, info=True) }}
    {{ return(results_list) }}

{%- endmacro %}

Thats what I thought, but thank you for the confirmation! 

You raise a good point about the tradeoffs -- I'll definitely go back and take a look and see if some of them should just be a separate model and seed.

1. ERD generators may not work with your analytics database. As @josh explains:

>I think a lot of these tools work fairly well if the PK/FK relationships are stated in the database. And in a well-engineered OLTP system this is normally done. It makes a lot less sense to put the relationships in a Snowflake or a Redshift, because for the most part they are not enforced and it is not actually possible to enforce them. So it’s not nearly as common to do so. But the downside of that is that the tools like ERD drawers and BI tools have a lot harder time than deducing the table relationships.

2. Separating your documentation from your codebase means one will always lag behind the other. As @Andrea writes:
> I did make ERDs with Lucidchart for the data mart - didn’t add it to dbt but to the self-service how-to documentation I created in the BI tool we were using. I only did it for 5 rock solid essential time tested star schema tables that I knew I wouldn’t have to worry about editing a lot.  Everything people are saying about maintaining documentation divorced from code absolutely applies here - check out [this post](https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/data_dictionaries/) on Locally Optimistic about “Why you don’t need a data dictionary” - it delves into some of the problems of documenting data. 

If you have a tool you use for ERDs, feel free to add it in the comments! I also suspect there's a way to parse the `manifest.json` file and use a language like dbdiagram's [database markup language](https://www.dbml.org/home/) to turn the relationships in your project into entity-relationships!",1

We’ll look at Kristin’s session and also focus on the numerous Fivetran dbt packages that have been published to date.

## What is a dbt Package?

Packages are dbt projects that you can install in your own dbt project.

There are two main use cases for packages.

First, we’ll start with common staging models for a single data source. An example of this is Fivetran’s [dbt package for Netsuite](https://hub.getdbt.com/fivetran/netsuite/latest/). Models are great for one particular source data or for sources that have industry-standard metrics or any code that analysts are re-creating

Secondly, we have packages that serve as macros, such as [dbt-utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt_utils/latest/), which will help you with any complex SQL querying. So for example, in [dbt-utils](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils), there’s a macro that you can pivot some data from rows to columns, which is quite helpful.

To see all available dbt packages - be sure to check out the [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/)
![hub screenshot|690x368](upload://uj3M3lqMNRJyQ9gNpTDHrILciir.png)
## How We Write Our dbt Packages

Let’s walk through the steps we follow at Fivetran for building a new dbt package from scratch.

### Research Customer Needs

The first step is to interview the stakeholders of the source data and find out:

* What they’re doing with their data
* How they’re modeling it
* Any pain points they’ve encountered when modeling data.

In our case, at Fivetran, the whole goal of creating these packages is to make customers' and analysts' lives easier so that they can better understand their data and get answers quicker.

### Understand source application and schema

Once we’ve gained enough feedback, we try to imagine what can be created with a data source that involves little customization with the intent to generate the query in a way that it will work accurately for everyone, so that's pretty important.

So generally when we talk to customers, if they have some customization and they're building this really specific model, it's not a good candidate for a package model. It's generally something that they'll have to write on their own.

### Draft Queries and Test

The most time-intensive part of the process is drafting queries and testing those queries. It’s important to QA the queries as much as possible and ensure that resulting data matches what’s in your reporting tool, if it’s relevant to your package and process.

### Build The Package

Now, it’s time to convert SQL queries to models. In our case, we use dbt-utils on all of the packages so far for the cross-database macros. All of the packages are compatible across Redshift, BigQuery, and Snowflake. To make this possible, we utilize some of the macros that Claire and the Fishtown team have built.

### Add Documentation

Lastly, but we add documentation to all of the source tables that are coming in through Fivetran and also the transformed models. In our case, we add descriptions to tables, columns and so on.

### Test, Launch and Solicit Feedback

We also add testing, so for example, dbt has a non-null and a unique test you can run on any column of data and we do this for all primary keys. We do that for all the primary keys, and they also have a couple of other tests that are pretty helpful.

Once we’re done, we ping the dbt Slack channel and gain beta testers. Through dialogue and testing, we make revisions and ultimately post it on the dbt Hub.

## Looking At Fivetran’s dbt Packages

Fivetran has published numerous dbt packages and will continue to bring additional resources for our customers. Our packages will take care of basic table standardization, add data tests and enable you to start building visualizations immediately.

So far, Fivetran has built and published the following packages:

* Fivetran [dbt package for NetSuite](https://fivetran.com/blog/fivetran-dbt-NetSuite)
* Fivetran [dbt package for Mailchimp](https://fivetran.com/blog/fivetran-dbt-Mailchimp)
* Fivetran [dbt package for Salesforce](https://fivetran.com/blog/fivetran-dbt-Salesforce)
* Fivetran [dbt package for GitHub](https://fivetran.com/blog/fivetran-dbt-github)
* Fivetran [dbt package for Marketo](https://fivetran.com/blog/fivetran-dbt-marketo)
* Fivetran [dbt package for Asana](https://fivetran.com/blog/fivetran-dbt-package-for-asana)

I think one of the best things about an open source project is that the community can contribute to it in multiple ways, including these, which is less about contributing to dbt _directly_ and about contributing to how you use it.

1478,"build-snapshot-based-tests-to-detect-regressions-in-historic-data","Every morning your CEO opens up their favorite dashboard. But one particular Monday, she finds that all of the historic revenue figures have changed! Suddenly, your Slack is filling up with messages asking what went wrong! And honestly, you're not sure at first — all of your `dbt test` steps passed earlier today, how could things have changed? Turns out, that one of the upstream teams has changed possible classifications which your model and tests didn't account for properly, and they applied those changes retroactively for the entire year.

You find the root-cause and fix it, however, you spent a couple of hours debugging what has happened, and your CEO is not particularly happy with you and seems to be growing suspicious of whether you really know what you're doing. No one wants to be there, right?

While dbt's schema tests are extremely useful, sometimes you need an extra layer of assurance that nothing is broken to get ahead of these issues. In this write-up, we're going to share how Zoox uses dbt's snapshots to detect when historic data changes as the result of execution of your pipeline, so that our data-team is the first one to know about those issues and can be proactive instead of reactive.

**Note:** We're assuming you are familiar with snapshots — if you're not, go read [this article](https://blog.getdbt.com/track-data-changes-with-dbt-snapshots/) about them first.

## The basic idea

We use dbt snapshots to detect changes in historic values for our rollup metrics and leverage the way snapshots invalidate the records that have changed for our test. A minimum working project that implements the whole workflow can be found [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-labs-experimental-features/tree/master/snapshot-testing) (huge shoutout to [Claire](https://discourse.getdbt.com/u/claire/summary) for putting it together!). Feel free cloning and trying it out!

Now let's go through the logic in more detail.

## Test implementation

Lets say we have a `fct_orders` table:


| order_id | customer_id | order_date | amount |
|----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 1        | 1           | 2020-07-01 | 10     |
| 2        | 3           | 2020-07-01 | 20     |
| 3        | 94          | 2020-07-02 | 1      |
| 4        | 50          | 2020-07-03 | 25     |
| 5        | 64          | 2020-07-03 | 17     |
| 6        | 54          | 2020-07-04 | 6      |


In our project, we build a snapshots on top of our most important models (like `fct_orders`) that roll the table up to one record per day. For this rollup query, assume that the order can be refunded/altered within the next calendar day, and that will alter the order amount. Hence, the revenue for orders that is older than 2 days should never change, right?

```sql
{% snapshot historic_revenue_snapshot %}

    {{
        config(
          target_schema='dbt_snapshots',
          strategy='check',
          unique_key='date_day',
          check_cols=['total_revenue']
        )
    }}

    select
        order_date as date_day,
        sum(amount) as total_revenue
    from {{ ref('fct_orders') }}
    where order_date < current_date - interval '1 day'

    group by 1

{% endsnapshot %}
```

After our first `dbt snapshot`, it looks something like this:


| date_day   | total_revenue | dbt_valid_from | dbt_valid_to |
|------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 2020-07-01 | 30            | 2020-07-15     | null         |
| 2020-07-02 | 1             | 2020-07-15     | null         |
| 2020-07-03 | 42            | 2020-07-15     | null         |
| 2020-07-04 | 6             | 2020-07-15     | null         |


Each day, we run this command, and since our historic daily revenue never changes, the `dbt_valid_to` field always should always be `null`. Right? Nothing ever goes wrong when it comes to data.

Except one day, something does go wrong. Somehow,  `order_id = 4` got filtered out, so our revenue for `2020-07-03` drops from `42` to `17` (it's an illustrative example so let's not get hang up on the feasibility of a record disappearing).

When we run our `dbt snapshot` command we can see that this historic value has changed — dbt has invalidated the old record, and created a new record for the affected day.


| date_day       | total_revenue | dbt_valid_from | dbt_valid_to   |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| 2020-07-01     | 30            | 2020-07-15     | null           |
| 2020-07-02     | 1             | 2020-07-15     | null           |
| **2020-07-03** | **42**        | **2020-07-15** | **2020-07-16** |
| **2020-07-03** | **17**        | **2020-07-16** | **null**       |
| 2020-07-04     | 6             | 2020-07-15     | null           |


So, the concept here is **we can add an `is_null` test to the `dbt_valid_to` column to detect when a metric has changed.**

We can do this with a [data test](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests/#data-tests), or by creating a [custom schema test](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/writing-custom-schema-tests) and applying it to the column.

In case if you go down the path of schema test, that's how your `schema.yml` in `snapshots` folder would look like:

```yaml
version: 2

snapshots:
  - name: historic_revenue_snapshot
    columns:
      - name: dbt_valid_to
        tests:
          - is_null # you need to create this test in your project
```

Then when you run `dbt test` you will see the following output:

```sql
$ dbt test
Running with dbt=0.17.1
Found 0 models, 1 test, 1 snapshot, 0 analyses, 137 macros, 0 operations, 1 seed file, 0 sources

```

*(The code for the custom schema test can be found [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-labs-experimental-features/blob/master/snapshot-testing/macros/test_is_null.sql))*

Now, when any historic records change, we'll be proactively notified about it!

## Healing the test

Now that we have a rogue record, our `is_null` test is going to fail every single time we run `dbt test`, even though we might have already fixed the issue.

To make our test ""self-healing"", we have an extra [operation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/hooks-operations/#operations) in our project to move invalidated records into an audit table.

You can find the full code [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-labs-experimental-features/blob/master/snapshot-testing/macros/historic_revenue_snapshot_cleanup.sql), but the idea is that you want to insert the invalidated version of the record into a different table, and delete it from the original table:

```sql
INSERT INTO dbt_snapshots.historic_revenue_snapshot_invalidated (
            SELECT
                *,
                CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as _inserted_at
            FROM {{ ref('historic_revenue_snapshot') }}
            WHERE dbt_valid_to IS NOT null
        );

DELETE FROM {{ ref('historic_revenue_snapshot') }} WHERE dbt_valid_to IS NOT null
```

The `historic_revenue_snapshot_invalidated` contains all records that have caused an error, while the `historic_revenue_snapshot` table no longer has records that will fail the `is_null` test:


| date_day       | total_revenue | dbt_valid_from | dbt_valid_to   |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| 2020-07-01     | 30            | 2020-07-15     | null           |
| 2020-07-02     | 1             | 2020-07-15     | null           |
| **2020-07-03** | **17**        | **2020-07-15** | **null**       |
| 2020-07-04     | 6             | 2020-07-15     | null           |


So failures will only cause an error once, and it's extremely easy to debug any past failures thanks to the `_invalidated` table (it's a good practice to additionally have snapshots of your core tables to make debugging even easier, i.e. so that you will be able to zero in on exact record that caused you trouble, even if you're not running any tests on them).

## Putting it all together

Running this in production does get a little complex — we chose to create one job per important model that covers all the steps.

```
$ dbt run-operation historic_revenue_snapshot_cleanup
$ dbt run -m +fct_orders
$ dbt snapshot --select historic_revenue_snapshot
$ dbt test -m historic_revenue_snapshot
```

By adding this to your production run of dbt, you can get ahead of any mistakes, building trust with your stakeholders in the process!",1

1478,"build-snapshot-based-tests-to-detect-regressions-in-historic-data","@evgeny.r  I have one query regarding using snapshot for fact tables.

Snapshot uses SCD-2, which makes me think this is for tracking dimensions and not facts.

Do you think this will scale well, or have you seen it scale well for large data. I am talking about hourly pipelines for 20 or 50+ api sources that are bringing in order transactions data on lets say a black friday.

Snapshots on fact table makes me think we are trying to apply a dimension technique (that too a slowly changing one) for a change data capture on facts that are incoming in bulk and changing way faster than dimensions would.

@somtom I checked your article too and realized you were snapshotting summary facts (sessions) which are surely not going to be huge compared to actual sessions data.

Do you think snapshotting is a viable option for stagged data (stg_sessions) and not modelled data (fct_sessions). Or will it become a performance bottleneck. 

Any help would be appreciated. :slight_smile:",3
1478,"build-snapshot-based-tests-to-detect-regressions-in-historic-data","@urwa when snapshotting staged data there might be different things to consider when it comes to performance concerns or the questions whether you need them at all:

* Can you snapshot it properly at all? Do you for instance have a unique key or do you have an EL job that appends newly or changed records? If the latter, a snapshot might not make too much sense since your EL job is kinda doing snapshots from the source.
* Would you expect the historical staging data to change at all? If not you might not need snapshots. If historical data does not change, then your snapshot table should not be much bigger than the original staging table itself.
* ..

Those are just some quick thoughts that came to my mind.

In our case, as you correctly wrote, we are snapshotting historical summary stats - mostly on modeled fact tables. Thus, we can check that they don't change. The main reasons for changes are that certain dimensions are adjusted in the source or that we do code changes that have side effects. We did not yet use snapshotting for staging tables, though.",4
1487,"writing-packages-when-a-source-table-may-or-may-not-exist","Note — this article is intended for:
- anyone that writes dbt modeling packages (likely a consultant or vendor)
- OR anyone who likes seeing fancy things done with dbt ;) 

In other words: you probably don't need this.

## Scenario
Let's say you're a consultant that's working with a number of merchants that use the same ecommerce software — **Shopiary**™. Your clients replicate the data into their warehouses using their favorite EL tool, and most of the time, the tables (and columns within the tables) are the same for each client — with one exception. Some stores implement a rewards program, and have a corresponding `rewards_status` table, whereas other stores do not.

You decide to write a dbt package to re-use across your clients (and open source it so the community can benefit too ;) ), **but** you need to figure out a way to handle the fact that sometimes the `rewards_status` table exists, and sometimes it doesn't.

## Part 1: Figuring out if a table exists in your warehouse
As someone who keeps up with the latest dbt developments, you're using [sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources/) in your dbt package. So you add the `rewards_status` table to your `shopiary` source:

```yaml
version: 2

sources:
- name: shopiary
  tables:
    - name: customers
    - name: orders
    - name: payments
    - name: rewards_status # we're not sure if this exists for all users of this package
    
```

An important note, it's probably a good idea to remove any `freshness` checks on this table (otherwise you'll get an error):
```yaml
    ...
    - name: rewards_status 
      freshness: null

```

In your downstream model (say, `stg_rewards_status`) you know the first thing you need to do is figure out a way to check if this table _actually_ exists. If we naïvely write logic like this:
```
{% set table_exists=source('shopiary', 'rewards_status') is not none %}

{% if table_exists %}

{{ log(""Table exists"", info=True) }}

{% else %}

{{ log(""Table does not exist"", info=True) }}

{% endif %}

```
dbt will return `table_exists=true`, since we're actually checking for the existence of the Source in your dbt project, rather than the existence of the table in your database (this is very nuanced).
```
$ dbt compile
Running with dbt=0.17.1
Table exists

15:03:57 |
Table exists
15:03:58 | Done.

```

So we need to do something slightly different. We can use the [`get_relation` macro](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/adapter#get_relation) to instead check your database instead of your dbt project:

```
{%- set source_relation = adapter.get_relation(
      database=source('shopiary', 'rewards_status').database,
      schema=source('shopiary', 'rewards_status').schema,
      identifier=source('shopiary', 'rewards_status').name) -%}

{% set table_exists=source_relation is not none %}

{% if table_exists %}

{{ log(""Table exists"", info=True) }}

{% else %}

{{ log(""Table does not exist"", info=True) }}

{% endif %}

```

15:07:01 | Done.
```
Cool! We can set a variable that tells us ""this table doesn't exist"".


Let's quickly check that it works for the positive case too (i.e. this isn't a false negative) — we _know_ `customers` exists for everyone:

```
{%- set source_relation = adapter.get_relation(
      database=source('shopiary', 'customers').database,
      schema=source('shopiary', 'customers').schema,
      identifier=source('shopiary', 'customers').name) -%}

{% set table_exists=source_relation is not none  %}

{% if table_exists %}

{{ log(""Table exists"", info=True) }}

{% else %}

{{ log(""Table does not exist"", info=True) }}

{% endif %}

```

```
$ dbt compile
Running with dbt=0.17.1
Table does not exist

15:08:09 | Concurrency: 1 threads (target='learn')
15:08:09 |
Table exists
15:08:10 | Done.
```

Huh, weird, it said it didn't exist, and then it did exist.... what gives?

## Part 2: Understanding the difference between the `parse` time and `run time`

When you execute `dbt compile` or `dbt run`, dbt parses your project twice:
* **First parse:** dbt reads all of the files in your project and generates a ""manifest"" comprised of models, tests, and other graph nodes present in your project. During this phase, dbt uses the  `ref`  statements it finds to generate the DAG for your project.  **No SQL is run during this phase**.
* **Second parse:** dbt compiles (and runs) each node (eg. building models, or running tests).  **SQL is run during this phase**

If you've ever used the [`execute` macro](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/execute/), you might have come across this behaviour

So, the reason customers ""does not exist"" and then suddenly ""exists"" is because:
* **First parse:** no SQL run, so the `source_relation` gets returned as `none`, resulting in a false negative.
* **Second parse:** This time dbt actually runs SQL against the `information_schema` of your database to check if the table exists. The `source_relation` gets returned when it exists.

OK, so maybe we can just use the results of the second parse to enable or model?

## Part 3: ""Enabling"" and ""disabling"" models based on whether the table exists (🙅‍♀️)

It may seem like a reasonable way to handle this optional table is to use the [`enabled` config](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/enabled/) to turn models on and off based on the existence of the table.

This might look something like:
```
{%- set source_relation = adapter.get_relation(
      database=source('shopiary', 'rewards_status').database,
      schema=source('shopiary', 'rewards_status').schema,
      identifier=source('shopiary', 'rewards_status').name) -%}

{% set table_exists=source_relation is not none  %}

{{ config(enabled=table_exists) }}

select ...
```
Unfortunately, this is not possible:
- dbt needs to know if a model is enabled at parse time, and since we're relying on querying the database to check if a model is exists (i.e run time), things are gonna get hairy!
- Even if there _were_ a workaround (maybe there is — I gave up on this approach when I got to here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯), this introduces complexity in any downstream models that `ref` the `stg_rewards_status` model — you'd need to selectively enable/disable that part of your code :grimacing: 

## Part 4: Fake it 'til you make it :sunglasses: 

Fortunately, there is a cool workaround here!
- Check if the table exists, using some of the code we just wrote
- If it exists, write the transformation the way you intend to
- If it doesn't, create a dummy, empty table instead with the exact same column names. Make sure you cast your `null`s to the right data-types in case they need to match datatype in downstream joins.

```sql
{# Not all stores have a concept of a rewards status, so it won't exist in every deployment #}

{%- set source_relation = adapter.get_relation(
      database=source('shopiary', 'rewards_status').database,
      schema=source('shopiary', 'rewards_status').schema,
      identifier=source('shopiary', 'rewards_status').name) -%}

{% set table_exists=source_relation is not none   %}

{% if table_exists %}

select
    id as reward_id,
    customer_id,
    tier

from {{ source('shopiary', 'rewards_status') }}

{% else %}

select
    null::integer as reward_id,
    null::integer as customer_id,
    null::integer as tier

-- this means there will be zero rows
where false

{% endif %}

```

Now, you can `ref` the model, and join to the `stg_rewards_status` table, just like any other model — `null` values will just flow though instead of real values. If your client later starts syncing the `rewards_status` table, the information will flow through as expected!

```sql
    select
        customers.customer_id,
        customers.first_name,
        customers.last_name,
        rewards_status.tier as rewards_tier -- this will just be null if the table doesn't exist

    from {{ ref('stg_customers')}} as customers
    left join {{ ref('stg_rewards_status') }} as rewards_status using (customer_id)
```

:sunglasses: :sunglasses: :sunglasses:

## Part 5: Other options!

There's always more than one way to peel a potato. You could also investigate:
- Abstracting the `table_exists` logic into a macro — a great idea if there are multiple optional tables!
- Creating the source table in the warehouse (this probably looks something like running a manual `create table` statement, using the role used by your EL tool). More complexity before getting to dbt, but keeps the package tidy.
- Having a user defined [variable](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-variables/) in your `dbt_project.yml` for whether the models related to `rewards_status` are enabled or not, and leaving it up to your user to set it to `true` or `false`. More configuration, but less code in your dbt project.",1
1487,"writing-packages-when-a-source-table-may-or-may-not-exist","I had trouble applying this to external tables in redshift. Turns out, as of this posting, the get_relation call does not include external tables in redshift.

1528,"testing-incremental-models","I love how dbt allows me to test schema and data :heart:, but there's one thing I haven't figured out - it's testing of incremental models.

My typical CI test run looks like this

    dbt deps --profiles-dir $DBT_PROFILE_DIR
    dbt seed --profiles-dir $DBT_PROFILE_DIR
    dbt run  --profiles-dir $DBT_PROFILE_DIR
    dbt test --profiles-dir $DBT_PROFILE_DIR

That works well for the `--full-refresh` case, which is basically what CI does, since it always run in a clean environment and DB. But the `--full-refresh` case is rare in production and what runs every day is processing incremental changes, which is left untested.

Not sure if it's relevant, but I use static data in my seeds to cover all edge cases. So the increment isn't always ""today"", but rather some static date in the past.

What would be a good approach to correctly test full + incremental transformations?

Cheers!",1
1528,"testing-incremental-models","
One thing that I've found makes this testing easier is to tag each row to identify whether it was built by your full-refresh or by a subsequent incremental.   You can do that with the is_incremental() function.

To make use of that, you can just add a column to each incremental table:   ""build_source"", like so:

{% if is_incremental() %}
   'incremental'     
{% else %}
   'full'
{% endif %}                       as ""build_source"",

When your model is built with --full-refresh (full build).  and then without it (incrementally), the rows will either have 'incremental' or 'full' as the value of column ""build_source"".

Once the column is populated, you can make use of that in your asserts and other test queries to see what the incremental did, like:

	select * from inventory
	where build_source = 'incremental'
	order by inventory.item_id, updated_at

... and of course you can write more sophisticated queries to test different conditions explicitly.",2
1528,"testing-incremental-models","@terry_joyce that is a very useful suggestion, thanks! Can you advise how you implemented testing in CI? We want to run dbt twice - once for the build_source run and a second time for the incremental run, and the source data will need to be updated between runs",3
1528,"testing-incremental-models","Hi Rob,

Since the table now contains the `build_source` column, it's a simple matter to identify which records were touched by the incremental.   You'd want to check that you are updating the records you intend to. 

If your incremental is efficient, it will have little overlap: records that get re-written on multiple passes of the incremental.   But it's not always desirable to have zero overlap.  Likely your incremental logic depends on one or more high water marks.  These are often max values of timestamp columns.  But depending on the nature of the source data, sometimes the timestamps you're relying on are created a bit out of order, and if you had no overlap you'd miss some rows.    

So that's one of the things you'd test for:  are you missing any records from the source data?   That probably requires a comparative query of the transformed table and the source data, looking at a specific datetime range after your last full build. 

You definitely want to run your schema tests on the updated models. Look for unexpected null values and non-unique keys where you expect them.  That might tell you if you're missing data, or if you're duplicating data.   Generally if your unique key is specified correctly, dbt will make sure you don't duplicate data.

I also like to do some column-by-column compares of rows created by incremental vs. before the incremental ran.   

Another aspect is efficiency. How long do these updates run per model? That you can just measure with the runtime information you'll get from dbt cloud or your logs.   It might take some experimentation to find the most efficient way to structure the dbt model to operate efficiently during incremental updates.


I'm sure there's a lot more written on this subject of testing incrementals.  It's a big topic, and one to which a more specific answer will include ""Depends on ...""",4
1547,"clean-your-warehouse-of-old-and-deprecated-models","dbt models persist in your production database even after they're deleted from your project. This adds clutter to the warehouse and can slow down operations like database or schema cloning, which are used frequently in CI/CD for snowflake dbt projects.

I wrote a macro that executes DROP statements for all the tables and views in your target schema that don't exist in your project. How does it work? First, it fetches all the models, seeds, and snapshots in your project. Then, it queries the information schema for all the models in your target schema excluding the ones fetched above. Finally, it formats (and then executes) DROP statements for each table/view that isn't in your project.

To invoke from the command line, use: `dbt run-operation drop_old_relations`

**Warning: This will delete everything in your target schema that isn't in your dbt project.**

EDIT: Added dryrun feature",1
1547,"clean-your-warehouse-of-old-and-deprecated-models","I love this! I modified the script slightly. The modified version below:
1. Provides the option of a dry run where the commands are printed, but not executed
2. Will match any schema prefixed with the target schema, rather than only the exact target schema (since we use multiple schemas of the form `<target_schema>_<schema_name>`). The exact target schema will still be matched. This introduces some risk if target schemas could overlap with *prefixes* of other schema names, so use with caution. It only matches strictly prefixes though, not a full wildcard, so if you're consistent with prefixing schemas this shouldn't be an issue.

One thing I have my development models in a different BQ project than my tables in production. So it looks this macro only works for me in my development project. 
How can I change the macro so it will work on my Production project as well when I run this macro in a job.
All my code is now 'transferred' to the right project via a macro: generate_database_name(), see code below.
I think I need to call  this macro somewhere from your macro to make it happen, but I don't know how.

1591,"custom-versions-of-generate-schema-name","Hello all dbt-ers!

There has been a lot of discussion in various places about how folks set up their dbt environments, databases, schemas/datasets, etc. I would like to share here the specific changes we have made to `generate_schema_name` and the basics of how we set up our build environment in the hope that it will be useful to others, and that they will in turn share theirs. Here is our code:

```{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name, node) -%}
    {%- set default_schema = target.schema -%}

    {%- if custom_schema_name is none -%}
        {{ default_schema }}

    {# If in dbt cloud, we always want models marked to generate in custom schemas
    to generate in just that specific schema, not with the prefixed default schema#}
    {%- elif target.name in ['dev-cloud','prod-cloud'] -%}
        {{ custom_schema_name }}

    {# If running in a local non-dbt-cloud environment then use the local schema 
    name no matter what #}
    {%- elif target.name not in ['dev-cloud', 'prod-cloud'] -%}
        {{ default_schema }}

    {# Should never arrive here #}
    {%- else -%}
        {{ default_schema }}_{{ custom_schema_name | trim }}
    {%- endif -%}

{%- endmacro %}
```
So the basics of it are this:

1. We use BigQuery and have two different projects, one project for all dev datasets and data, and one for all prod datasets and data. 
2. Our developers develop using dbt Core locally in feature branches. They submit PRs for the feature branches. If approved, the PRs get merged into our `dev` branch. Periodically we then merge from `dev` to `master`. 
3. We want our dbt cloud scheduled runs between dev and prod to be as close as possible to catch any issues and we also want our devs to be able to develop in their own ""sandboxes"" without stepping on or being stepped on by what the scheduled dbt cloud jobs in Dev are doing or each other.
4. Here is the list of datasets in our Dev environment and their purposes: a) ""analytics"" - Where end-user-facing published models are made available. b) ""sandbox"" - Where all intermediate and non-user facing temporary processing and models live c) ""snapshot"" -- Where our snapshots live d) A bunch of other datasets for raw sources as they are loaded e) ""dev_name_sandbox"" - variants of ""sandbox"" where individual devs do their development and testing when running w/ dbt Core

What we want in our `generate_schema_name` macro is something that, in our dbt cloud runs for both Dev and Prod, publishes all user-facing models into the `analytics` schema and all the temporary/intermediate models into `sandbox`. But for developers working locally, it should just publish all the models, whether user-facing or not, into their own local sandbox, which is specified in their profile file. This would also include if we do any other custom schema overrides for other models in the future, which we may do. So we are using targets for now in dbt cloud to differentiate this, although definitely hoping in the future to have an environment variable or some such thing to differentiate between dbt cloud jobs and locally run jobs.

Interested to see what others have done!",1
1592,"auto-pivot-json-string-using-schema-yml-in-bigquery","Let me start by giving you some background and apologies if the background is longer than the solution.

# Background

## The scenario:

* We work with BigQuery
* Working with events data split into two data sources due to the constraints of the source system
* One source is the main set of data, let us call it TABLE_MAIN
* The other is the ancillary or supportive data, let us call this one TABLE_SUPPORT
* There is a possibility of a 1:n relationship between TABLE_MAIN and TABLE_SUPPORT
* Join these two tables into one

Simple enough? Not so much. The complication is data in TABLE_SUPPORT. Why so?

* Not all events have the same support data, one event can have few columns and others can have hundreds.
  * Column one of events *evt_123* is not necessarily the same as column one of event *evt_456*
  * A lot of empty columns if all columns are mapped to each event
* Constraints of the source system
  * Only 20 columns of data per row. Multiple rows per event
  * Only 60 characters per column so one value of support data can span multiple columns of TABLE_SUPPORT. And if this happens on column 20 then one value of support data can span two rows.
* The source system can be enhanced with additional support data at any time

To help visualize:
**TABLE_MAIN**

| Field                 | Key | Notes |
| -------------------------- | :---: | --- |
| EVENTGUID_1 | X | |
| EVENTGUID_2 | X | |
| PROCESS_DATE    | X | |
| RECSEQ                  | X | Row sequence number if support data is across multiple rows |
| FIELDNAME 01 to 20   |    | Name |
| FIELDVALSEQ 01 to 20 |   | Sequence if value has been split |
| FIELDVALUE 01 to 20    |   | Value |

Got that? In the end, even though TABLE_SUPPORT has multiple rows for each event, it is only really one row’s worth of data per event. Which means that a 1:1 relationship between TABLE_MAIN and TABLE_SUPPORT is possible.

### The dbt Model:
I won’t go too much into how the mapping between the tables was done, suffice so say that arrays played a part. Basically it is this:

* Get TABLE_MAIN data
* Get TABLE_SUPPORT data
  * Create ARRAY
  * STRING_AGG ordering by FIELDVALSEQ
  * ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(FIELDNAME, FIELDVALUE)
* Join
* Tadah! You have TABLE_COMBINED with an array, which is an awesome feature of BQ (I’ve got a SAPBW background, no arrays there).

However, because of the data volume you end up with TABLE_COMBINED being of similar size to TABLE_SUPPORT and any queries on table TABLE_COMBINED will be pricey. An array is not suitable so as a final step we turn the array into a JSON string using `TO_JSON_STRING()`. Table size drops dramatically

Great, now we have a usable table with a JSON string containing all my event support data. 

How do I get the data out of this JSON string when querying the table? Easy, just use `JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(json_string,'$.fieldname') as fieldname`. Well easy if you are versed or comfortable with SQL and if you know what you are looking. But if you are a general user, the “select * and I’ll see what’s there” kind of user? Our solution to create a view with the JSON string automatically pivoted.

## Pivot Solution

You may say easy, we all know what dbt allows us to auto-generate a repeated set of code using macros. And you are right, just:

* Create a macro
* Put the JSON extract command in a FOR loop with a field list,
* Call the macro and provide the field list

But consider these questions:

* What if I do not want to manually provide field list?
* What if I do not want developer changing my model every time the source system is enhanced, especially if the model itself does not really change?
* What I need to make sure the correct data type is used as the end result of `JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR()` is always a string?
* When should `CAST()` be used or `DATE()` be used  instead of `PARSE_DATE()` etc.

Here is how I did it:
### schema.yml
My first thought was the schema.yml for each model. This document needs to be updated every time the model gets updated. And I would rather it be changed that a model, less likelihood of breaking things.  Is it possible to use the schema to drive the pivoting and the associated rules?

One of the options in the schema is meta. I ask the question in slack about its use and Taylor Murphy’s  [response](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C0VLZPLAE/p1595326412121300) helped me greatly. I decided to use the meta option and add three values. Note that this is the target table/view schema.

* `JSON: False or True` – Mandatory for columns in JSON string
* `data_type: DATE`
* `rule: Parse` – rule applied to data_type. Blank = DATE(), parse = PARSE_DATE() etc. more rules can be added if required. 

### Macro
Now that I had my driver my macro just needed to the following, with a lot of if statements:

* Get a list of columns from the schema
* Loop through columns.
  * Get JSON string columns only
  * Extract based on Data Type
  * Get conversion rule if column is a Time Dimension

I tried to keep the macro dynamic, not limited to my model or the name of the JSON string.

### Model

The hard part is done. Now I just need to call the macro passing the right arguments and it is done.

### Recap
The schema.yml file is critical. All developer now needs to do is make sure that any additional support data from the source system is added to the proper schema.yml, the macro will do the rest.

I am thinking that the meta option in schema will be used more in future.
Hope this was helpful.

But I think most BI products (atleast Chartio) handle nulls fine these days - we don't just have it ""appear as a blank"" in menus.

This article was prompted by a question from a team member :)

### Our data
Let's say we have a table with one record per user, per day they were active:
| user_id | date_day   | is_active | 
|---------|------------|-----------| 
| 1       | 2020-08-01 | true      | 
| 1       | 2020-09-01 | true      | 
| 1       | 2020-09-04 | true      | 
| 1       | 2020-09-05 | true      | 
| 1       | 2020-09-12 | true      | 
| 1       | 2020-09-17 | true      | 
| 2       | 2020-09-01 | true      | 


### The problem
We've been asked to create reports for daily, weekly, and monthly active users.

On the surface, we know that we could calculate daily active users like this:

**Daily active users**
```
select
   date_day,
   count(distinct user_id) as daily_active_users
from {{ ref('user_active_days') }}
group by 1
order by 1
```

| date_day   | daily_active_users | 
|------------|--------------------| 
| 2020-08-13 | 1                  | 
| 2020-09-01 | 2                  | 
| 2020-09-04 | 1                  | 
| 2020-09-05 | 1                  | 
| .. | ..                  |

(Note, we haven't filled in the missing days, which might be something worth doing ;) )

We can follow similar patterns for weekly and monthly active users, to generate outputs like this.
<details>
<summary>Weekly active users SQL</summary>

```
select
   date_trunc('week', date_day) as date_week,
   count(distinct user_id) as weekly_active_users
from {{ ref('user_active_days') }}
group by 1
order by 1
```
</details>


| date_week  | weekly_active_users | 
|------------|---------------------| 
| 2020-08-10 | 1                   | 
| 2020-08-17 | 1                   | 
| 2020-08-24 | 1                   | 
| 2020-08-31 | 2                   | 
| 2020-09-07 | 1                   | 
| 2020-09-14 | 1                   | 


<details>
<summary>Monthly active users SQL</summary>

```
select
   date_trunc('month', date_day) as date_month,
   count(distinct user_id) as monthly_active_users
from {{ ref('user_active_days') }}
group by 1
order by 1
```
</details>

| date_month | monthly_active_users | 
|------------|----------------------| 
| 2020-08-01 | 1                    | 
| 2020-09-01 | 2                    | 


However, wouldn't it be :cool: if we could see this changing on a daily basis? That can feel strange when thinking about ""monthly active users"" for a day in the middle of the month, but essentially we want to get to something like this — for each day:
- How many active users were there today?
- How many active users were there in the last week / 7 days?
- How many active users were there in the last month / 30 days?

The ""semi-additive"" nature of these metrics means that we can't just add up our daily active users each week to get the number of weekly active users, so the way to get here may not feel immediately obvious.

### The solution
Fortunately we've seen this pattern before! 

Before we can build the summary table, we need to build a table with one record per user, per day (regardless of whether they were active that day or not), and fill in columns for:
- `active_today`
- `active_l7_days`
- `active_l30_days`



To solve this, you'll need to use a [date spine](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/finding-active-days-for-a-subscription-user-account-date-spining/265) and some window functions.

<details>
<summary>SQL to create this table</summary>

```
with user_active_days as (
    select * from {{ ref('user_active_days') }}
),

all_days as (
    select * from {{ ref('all_days') }}

    select
        user_id,
        min(date_day) as first_active_day
    from user_active_days
    group by 1
),

-- use a date spine to fill in missing days
spined as (
    select
        user_first_active_day.user_id,
        all_days.date_day
    from user_first_active_day
    left join all_days
        -- all days after the user was first active
        on all_days.date_day >= user_first_active_day.first_active_day
),

filled as (
    select
        spined.date_day,
        spined.user_id,

        coalesce(user_active_days.is_active, false) as is_active_today,

        max(is_active_today) over (
            partition by spined.user_id
            order by spined.date_day
            rows between 6 preceding and current row
        ) as is_active_l7_days,

        max(is_active_today) over (
            partition by spined.user_id
            order by spined.date_day
            rows between 29 preceding and current row
        ) as is_active_l30_days

    from spined

    left join user_active_days
        on spined.date_day = user_active_days.date_day
        and spined.user_id = user_active_days.user_id

| .. | ..       | ..           | ..             | ..               |



Once we have this, it's a reasonably simple hop from that table to our goal table (shown above):

Do you mean multiple times in the same day? The initial table is at the grain of user and day:

[quote=""claire, post:1, topic:1631""]
### Our data

Let’s say we have a table with one record per user, per day they were active:

|user_id|date_day|is_active|
| --- | --- | --- |
|1|2020-08-01|true|
|1|2020-09-01|true|
|1|2020-09-04|true|
|1|2020-09-05|true|
|1|2020-09-12|true|
|1|2020-09-17|true|
|2|2020-09-01|true|
[/quote]

This line:
[quote=""claire, post:1, topic:1631""]
`min(date_day) as first_active_day`
[/quote]
Is to facilitate the date spine - by doing an inequality join you can get a row for every day even if they didn't log in. See https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/finding-active-days-for-a-subscription-user-account-date-spining/265 for a more in depth discussion",3
1658,"here-is-a-way-to-write-dbt-docs-as-sql-comment","dbt docs took out so much pain of keeping concise and fresh documentation. And it is beautiful!
But am I alone wanting to keep the documentation even closer to the code, maybe within SQL files themselves, just like Python docstring? I would give no excuse for out-of-sync docs to myself this way.

So, I just created `dbtdocstr` command. You need Python 3 to run this command.

:blue_heart: I may not be aware of any similar programs and I may be just embarrassing myself, but I found this little tool to be useful and am hoping that it does good for others, too. :slightly_smiling_face:

From [REAME.md](https://github.com/anelendata/dbt_docstring/blob/master/README.md):
## Install

```
pip install dbt_docstring
```

## How does it work?

dbtdocstr command scans .sql files under dbt's models directories and look for a block that begins with  ```` ```dbt````  and end with ````  ``` ````. Inside the block you can write the content of the models section of schema.yml corresponding to the current table as specified in [dbt document](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation/):

Example (<dbt_project_root_directory>/models/api_key_status.sql)

````
/*
# API key status

This table lists the API keys with the status.

```dbt
columns:
  - name: api_key
    description: API key
    tests:
      - unique
  - name: enabled
    description: True if API key is enabled status
  - name: update_datetime
    description: Last update date and time
```
*/
SELECT
   api_key,
   enabled,
   update_datetime
FROM {{ ref('my_api_key_list') }}
````

Then run:

```
dbtdocstr <dbt_project_root_directory>
```

These two files will be auto-generated from each .sql file in the dbt project:

`models/docs.md` :

```
{% docs api_key_status %}
# API key status

This table lists the API keys with the status.
{% enddocs %}
```

`models/schema.yml` :

```
version: 2
models:
  - name: api_key_status
    description: '{{ docs(""api_key_status"") }}'
    columns:
      - name: api_key
        description: API key
        tests:
          - unique
      - name: enabled
        description: True if API key is enabled status
      - name: update_datetime
        description: Last update date and time
  - name: ...
```

To see the document generation, use dbt command:

```
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

### Notes

* The doc must be a SQL comment block comment that begins with '/*' and ends with '*/'
* The first comment block will be extracted.
* The dbt block is searched within the first comment block.
* Any text after the dbt block will be ignored.
* dbt's Docs Blocks feature can be used only for table & view description. Not column descriptions.
* `dbtdocstr --backup <dbt_root_directory>`  to create backup files of schema.yml and docs.yml if they exsit.
* You should be able to add test",1

My team and I have been thinking about testing lately and throughout this thinking I did a deep-dive into the current state of testing in dbt. In this post, I will try to motivate the importance of testing, present research I've collected about testing in dbt, make some conclusions from that research, and finally make some suggestions for advancement of testing in dbt.

I tagged a lot of folks on this post, would love to get more input, more research, and opinions here. Thanks!

## Motivation

Presently, dbt offers [two types of tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests/), **schema tests** and **data tests**. For the purpose of this post, I will refer to these types of tests as dbt's **primitive tests** in the sense they are implemented in the dbt core and can be used in more sophisticated ways. _Schema tests_ are good for enforcing constraints that RDBMS systems typically offer but analytical databases don't. Meanwhile, _data tests_ can test anything with endless possibilities.

Zooming out a bit from dbt, I would like to motivate the value of [testing in software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing). The points here are applicable to all software projects including dbt projects.

### Why should I test software?

With software tests, an engineer can:

*   reduce the likelihood of an unexpected outcome or side-effect from code or system under test,
*   reduce the likelihood that a current or future code change will introduce a system error,
*   inspire confidence in the test author and others that the code or system under test works as-intended, and
*   document code and system behavior by illustrating edge-cases.

There are two parts to testing: writing tests and running tests. Both of these parts are necessary for a useful test suite to provide the above benefits.

### How should I test software?

A good test typically verifies *something:* that a piece of code behaves a certain way under certain conditions, or that a system functions in a certain way.

There are many established ways to test software, each with its own strengths and suitability. I would argue that the _best_ way to test highly depends on what is trying to be accomplished, e.g., prevent code regressions, ensure a contract, introduce a new working feature. The level of effort for testing scales depending on the situation.

I would like to highlight two testing categories that I think are relevant to dbt:

*   **[Smoke testing:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software))** ""Where there's smoke, there's fire."" A smoke test confirms that the system under test looks and/or behaves a certain way. Smoke tests are used in blue/green deployment pipelines as a last-step check before cutover; if the smoke test fails, then the deployment pipeline fails. Smoke tests are difficult to run at development-time because it requires the entire production system to be functioning for the developer. Smoke tests are particularly effective in continuous deployment pipelines to help catch issues difficult to detect at development-time. Smoke tests are a sign of a mature system.
*   **[Unit testing:](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html)** A unit test proves that a ""unit"" of code works as expected. A unit test commonly has three steps: setup, execute the code under test, and verification/teardown section. A unit can vary in size, from a single function, to an entire class. Unit tests are self-contained and typically do not test functionality of external systems (e.g., using HTTP calls or database connections). ""Mocking"" is a common technique used during unit tests and is often essential for unit testing. Unit tests are run at development-time and during continuous integration to detect breakages before code reaches production.

Testing can occur at a variety of points in the software development lifecycle. Unit tests are typically run at development-time (i.e., when the code is being developed) and during continuous integration (i.e., when the code is being merged into the main branch of the project). Smoke tests are typically run during continuous deployment (i.e., when the code/data is being deployed to production).

(For more on testing in software, I recommend to consult [Martin Fowler's writing](https://www.martinfowler.com/testing/)!)

## Community research

I have conducted research about dbt by reading through blog posts, GitHub issues, and dbt Discourse. I’ve found there are a number of community members who described their attempts at and/or the challenges of building advanced tests to suit their needs:

*   Petyo Pahunchev [pointed out](https://www.infinitelambda.com/post/dbt-testing-tools-gap) that primitive tests (schema tests and data tests) leave a gap in dbt development, saying ""there is no tool to let us deterministically re-create a set of conditions, execute our code and validate the output."" In his post, he suggested a way to create tests using a Python library to allow for a **behavioural-driven development** methodology in dbt.
*  @michael-kaminsky [outlined](https://kaminsky.rocks/2020/09/tdd-for-elt/) the challenges of adopting a **test driven development** approach in ELT. He made a number of good points, including ""it takes a lot of work to generate realistic test-cases"", and ""executing a pipeline and testing it can take upwards of 10 minutes — this is way too slow for doing real test-driven development"".
*   MichelleArk [described](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2354) their team's attempt of hand-constructing static CSVs, building macros, and running primitive tests to assert model behavior generally and in edge cases. Ultimately, they wrap up the GitHub issue saying ""a general issue with this approach is that writing assertions for **unit tests** feels quite unnatural in SQL - it's tricky even to get the right semantics for an equality check."" Later in the post, I described my approach to **black box testing** pl/pgsql transformations using Python.
*   @fabrice.etanchaud [noted](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2740) that with the new --defer flag, there may be a way to automate **non-regression tests** ([see diagram](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60448514)). Later in the post, @jtcohen [described](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2740#issuecomment-717670524) how to **mock** a dbt model using macros and run-time variables.

Despite these challenges, there are successful examples of building advanced tests using dbt's primitive tests or by building scaffolding around dbt:



*   @claire's [described](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/testing-with-fixed-data-set/564/2) how to test with dbt using a fixed dataset. Her fixed dataset consists of ""fake data consisting of all my known edge cases so that I can check that my SQL works."" She noted she only does this testing during development, and it’s not clear if engineers returning to her code are able to run these tests.
*   @claus [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwUonA3mDg&feature=youtu.be) how to run primitive dbt tests as a **smoke test** during a blue/green data deployment. If the smoke tests pass, then the dbt output is made available for use; otherwise the data deployment fails.
*   @gnilrets [built](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/testing-data-transformations/733) a well-documented testing framework outside of dbt. A developer using the framework may write **testing specifications** for a data transformation, and the framework verifies the spec.
*   The [dbt-utils](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils) project has a series of **integration tests** that verify project functionality across the supported database. Meanwhile [dbt-audit-helper](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-audit-helper) has macros that can supercharge dbt data tests.

## Conclusions

Based on this research, I conclude the following:

1. Strategies for smoke testing in dbt have been discovered and documented by the community.
2. Meanwhile, there is a high barrier-to-entry to advanced development-time dbt testing strategies. To achieve advanced dbt testing, one either needs expert-level knowledge of dbt, or a high investment of individual time.
3. There's a general desire for advancing development-time testing capabilities inside or outside of dbt and community members are looking for capabilities known in the field of software testing.


## Suggestions

Here are some concrete suggestions that I think will advance testing in dbt:



*   Product: Map out the current development-time testing workflow and map out an improved development-time testing workflow.
*   Technical: Make ""mocking"" a dbt model and dbt source a well-designed and first-class construct in dbt. I think many of the community members I referenced above could benefit from a well-defined approach to mocking in dbt.
*   Documentation: Motivate testing in the dbt docs and present the trade-offs of testing. Promote testing best-practices and advanced testing strategies in the dbt docs. (What does a well-tested model look like? When should tests be run? See [React Testing](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html) for an example.)

Looking forward to continuing the discussion!",1
1778,"state-of-testing-in-dbt","Hi!

This is something I think about as well, as a Software Engineer coming into data and using dbt. I love dbt and how it works, it's such a great tool.

One of the things I have also thought about is testing, and how we ensure data is correct when building our pipeline:

- We use schema tests in our models to ensure not_null etc, and using dbt-utils package for helpers.
- We have a csv which has specific columns, setup like this:

```
description,table_name,where_field,where_value,test_field,test_value
A customer has this weird edge case for a field,fct_foobar,customer_id,cd8e741c-1436-4145-bf00-b3e59fbf73f7,my_awesome_field,foopytoopy
```

So this then has a python script which looks for this file under data/data_tests.csv which will build out tests in tests/generated/xxx.sql, which will have the following content:

```
{{ config(tags=['tests']) }}
{{test_where_exists('fct_foobar','customer_id','cd8e741c-1436-4145-bf00-b3e59fbf73f7','my_awesome_field','foopytoopy')}}
```

The macro looks like this:
```
{% macro test_where_exists(model, where_field, where_value, test_field, test_value) %}
select {{where_field}}, {{test_field}} from {{ ref(model) }} where {{where_field}} = '{{where_value}}' and {{test_field}} != '{{ test_value }}'
{% endmacro %}
```

This is great as we can build this against random edge cases and ""known good"" orders. If something breaks we'll know straight away.

We're also planning on using a tool like great expectations to test our data models.",2
1778,"state-of-testing-in-dbt","@joshtaylor thanks for sharing! This is quite clever, at which point in the development lifecycle do you run this test? At development-time, or at deploy-time?

I like the name `test_where_exists`, I wonder if semantic macros in a dbt package could be added to make improve the baseline of development-time testing. An idea I have for this is `exact_match` like so:

```
-- BigQuery Standard SQL:

{% macro exact_match(test_dataset_query, query_under_test) %}
(
    ({{ test_dataset_query }})
    except distinct
    ({{ query_under_test }})
)
union all 
(
    ({{ query_under_test }})
    except distinct
    ({{ test_dataset_query }})
)
{% endmacro %}
```

Then two more macros that can be used similarly:

- `is_contained_within(test_dataset_query, query_under_test)`
- `does_not_contain(test_dataset_query, query_under_test)`

Applying this in a data test (borrowing from [`jaffle_shop`](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/jaffle_shop)):

```
{% set test_dataset_query %}
select 'mperez0@chronoengine.com' as email, 33 as customer_lifetime_value union all
select 'smccoy1@reddit.com' as email, 23 as customer_lifetime_value union all
select 'kpayne2@cargocollective.com' as email, 65 as customer_lifetime_value
{% endset %}

{% set query_under_test %}
select
    email,
    customer_lifetime_value
from {{ ref('dim_customers') }} as dim_customers
left join {{ ref('raw_customers') }} as raw_customers
    on raw_customers.id = dim_customers.customer_id
{% endset %}

{{ exact_match(test_dataset_query, query_under_test) }}
```

Now imagine being able to define which `ref`s are mocked and how in the above data test file, I think that would be a great developer experience for a self-contained ""unit test"" in a single file. @jerco curious to get your thoughts on the feasibility of that idea.",3
1778,"state-of-testing-in-dbt","We run these tests in development using filtering, but we also have a ""sample"" target set in the dbt `profiles.yml`.

We then have a filter in our models to filter by this id, as we want to filter orders that match usually :slight_smile:

So inside of our staging models, we do:
```
{{filter_if_sample_target_by('order_id')}}
```

we then have a python script which builds this macro:
```
file = open(f""./macros/join_orders.sql"", ""w"")
macro = ""{% macro filter_if_sample_target_by(source_column_name) %} {% if target.name == 'sample' %} where {{source_column_name}} in (""
macro += ""'""+""','"".join(ids)+""'""
macro += "") {% endif %} {% endmacro %}""
file.write(macro)
file.close()
```

Now our dataset in development goes down to ~150 records and is a lot faster to build against. :slight_smile:",4
1778,"state-of-testing-in-dbt","@boxysean thank you so much for pulling together this excellent literature review. You've really nailed  the capabilities and constraints of testing with dbt at the end of 2020, as they are and (even more importantly) as they're understood to be.

I'm excited to watch [two](https://www.getdbt.com/coalesce/agenda/building-a-robust-data-pipeline-with-dbt-airflow-and-great-expectations) [talks](https://www.getdbt.com/coalesce/agenda/empowering-your-data-team-through-testing) about testing + dbt over the next two days; and since I'm already overdue to responding to this, I thought I'd leave a few thoughts here now.

## If you can write it in SQL, you can test it

As I see it today, dbt testing can be quite full-featured—**the primitive tests can do _a lot_**—so long as you're willing to write the code for it. Data tests are a great tool for one-off assurances; you just need the SQL that selects the rows you're sure shouldn't be there. When those assurances need to become assertions, standardized and cross-applicable, rather than copy-pasting data tests and swapping out a line or two, it's simple enough to DRY up that code, parametrize the inputs (`model`, `column_name`), and wrap it in a Jinja macro prefixed `test__`. Write a bit more Jinja, and you can end up somewhere very fancy indeed:

- unit testing of one model's logic via in-file fixtures, following Sean's and Josh's examples above
- mock data in seeds, supplied by an external library like [faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/), that stand in place of your real source data via a `source()` override, and enable full end-to-end DAG testing
- leveraging inferential statistics to identify outliers or aberrations, via [BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-to-use-bigquery-ml-for-anomaly-detection) + [dbt_ml](https://hub.getdbt.com/kristeligt-dagblad/dbt_ml/latest/), or by building on a unified multilingual platform like Databricks

All of which is to say, the fact that dbt only ships with four schema tests never struck us as a limitation: those four are the *starting points* , and the code is simple enough that users can write many, many more. There are a dozen custom schema tests in [dbt-utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt_utils/latest/). @claus wrote several dozen more in [dbt-expectations](https://hub.getdbt.com/calogica/dbt_expectations/latest/), replicating many of the great ones in [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/).

In this way and many others, dbt is a framework—a way of writing code, wrapped in boilerplate—more than it is a library. The same holds true for materializations, strategies, default macros, and the rest: the fact that a user can override, adapt, and extend built-in code to accomplish their unique use case is one of dbt's biggest features.

## Better built-ins

All of that said, I think there are a number of obvious, uncontroversial ways to make tests *more* accessible and powerful out-of-the-box. By virtue of their age, there are also a few things about tests that don't make a lot of sense, and we should fix that. We want to make those changes soon, ahead of [dbt v1.0](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A1.0.0).

Here are some of the things on my wishlist:

* Data tests should be configurable and documentable.
* Schema tests and data tests should both return a set of failing rows, rather than a numeric value count(*) for the former and a set of rows for the latter. Why? Because...
* dbt should make it easier to debug errant tests in development, by (optionally) writing the failing records to database tables.
* Users should have the option of setting warn and error severity via thresholds (absolute or a relative %), similar to source freshness.
* When a user creates a schema test, they should feel they are building a reusable asset, not just hacking together one more macro to maintain. Schema test blocks (!) should have optional configurations like description and human-friendly failure messages. Those assets are even more valuable when packaged up and open sourced.
* At the same time, you shouldn't need a custom schema test to do something obvious, like add a `where` filter or a `limit`. All schema tests should have the ability to apply those configs, right out of the box.

(Check the [v0.20.0 milestone](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/milestone/62) for detailed issues on most of the above.)

## Lowering barriers

Will this solve everything? No, definitely not—it doesn't even begin to touch on some of the coolest things Sean noted above. I agree first and foremost, however, that there is too high a barrier separating `unique` + `not_null` from more advanced usage, and not enough scaffolding along the way.

I'd love to end up in a place where we add native support for mock data + unit testing, following an opinionated + thoughtful approach that reflects a community-driven consensus. If we're going to get there, we need to focus on solidifying the simple stuff today: making the case that dbt testing is fully featured in its own right, and fully extensible in yours.

I want dbt developers to feel comfortable investing their time and energy in pushing the limits of tests. I know we have work to do here;  I'm reminded of it every time I hear someone suggest that dbt's built-in schema tests are fine as baby steps, on the way toward using a separate dedicated test framework. (Other frameworks, including GE, are great! If it's not already clear, they inspire a lot of my thinking here.) I hope that the technical changes I listed above are a reasonable set of steps on the way there.

At the same time, I so agree with Sean's suggestion that a big, big piece of this is less about technical change and more about a clearer narrative in the documentation:

- We should talk about schema test definitions more like models, snapshots, and seeds—things you expect to *create*—rather than just as things you expect to *use*, and quickly grow out of.
- We should clarify the building blocks for folks who want to build more complex systems. If you're writing unit tests, should you make your equality comparisons using custom code? The widely used [dbt_utils.equality()](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils#equality-source) schema test? The beloved [audit_helper.compare_relations()](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-audit-helper/tree/0.3.0/#compare_relations-source) macro? Why not the [adapter.get_rows_different_sql()](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/dev/kiyoshi-kuromiya/core/dbt/adapters/base/impl.py#L1177-L1233) adapter method, which is used in our adapter-testing suite?
- We should encourage more community-contributed tooling that reinforces a culture of testing, tightly integrated with models, such as @tnightengale's [new package](https://hub.getdbt.com/tnightengale/dbt_meta_testing/latest/) that offers a way to enforce test + documentation coverage.
- We should tell a story about tests being expressive attributes of models, ones that can validate, document, and communicate their meaning. They are (dare I say it) rich pieces of metadata.

Wherever possible, we should have solid recommendations, use cases, and trade-offs. The most intrepid dbt developers have already done promising work here. I want to see many more community members taking measurable risks, pulling on some threads, and reporting back with their ideas and findings—without feeling like they've gone off the deep end. I promise, I'm right there with you.",5
1778,"state-of-testing-in-dbt","Hi all !

As a former software engineer, I met something called ""[design by contract](https://www.eiffel.com/values/design-by-contract/introduction/)"". The idea, proposed by Bertrand Meyer (another French citizen, sorry ;-)), implemented in the Eiffel language, is taken from [Hoare's triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic), and I wonder how it could be used to validate a model. I'd like to take a little time to explain myself, and ask you to question the idea heartly !

Folks in the Eiffel world use this every day, and this reduces heavily the need for unit tests that can only test for presence of an error (In fact, there is even a way to automatically produce unit tests based on the notion below). 

The idea to test for correctness, instead of looking for defects, could be translated in our dbt world like this : 
given :

* a model M, implementation of a data transformation referencing zero or more direct upstream models as input
* a list of tests (data tests, schema tests on the direct upstream models) known as M's **precondition**
* a list of tests (data tests, schema tests on M), known as M's **postcondition**

M correctness can be express like this : 

Any run of the model started in a state where its precondition holds will end up in a state where its postcondition holds, something like `dbt test_precondition -m M; dbt run -m M; dbt test_postcondition -m M`

It's quite intuitive, think about a transformation where a numeric column of a upstream model must be non null and positive for example, because M in its transformation computes its square root.

Then, to prove correctness of all/part of your transformation chain, you only have to run it with precondition and/or postcondition enabled on all/a subset of the models. If dbt ends up correctly, that's all correct.

What do you think of this idea ?

With these glasses on, one could already see schema tests being already : 
* part of the postcondition of the model (as it constrains the underlying transformation)
* part of the precondition of all direct downstream models based on the model (as direct downstream transformations may rely on M schema tests).

So one could envision : 

New model properties : 
* `require` :  precondition tests, pretty like `tests` at model level, but with the ability to also list data tests
* `ensure` (could remain `tests`  ) :  postcondition tests, idem, but at model or column level.
In fact, may a direct upstream model have no schema tests, on could even add tests at column level in the M `require` block for needed upstream model columns.

New model configuration : 
* `assertion` : an array of possibly `'require'`, `'ensure'` values, used to configure level of correctness for that model (will test_pre or/and test_post be executed ?).
Thinking out loud, this could also be useful in jinja code, to assert that some condition holds at a given time in a macro's code. One could envision a macro like `check(boolean)`. In that case one could add a extra `'check'` value to the list, used to enable assertions in jinja.

So yes, it's all goes down to a kind of intertwined `dbt run + test` at model level !
And to follow on @jerco 's comment, these tests are more than tests, they are contracts, first class citizens of a model's metadata : *""if you run me under these preconditions, I will ensure you these postconditions""*

Of course, the new config above would be used to disable the tests in production.
To enforce eventual consistency, this mechanism should allow to defer relationships test at the end of the dbt run.

Do you think it could be valuable ?

In fact, this notion is so powerful that it could even be used to synchronize parallel executions of DAG parts (Eiffelists call that [SCOOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCOOP_(software))).

Imagine you partition the DAG, assigning a processor/thread to each partition. model B and model A in two distinct partitions, affected to distinct execution threads. B's precondition contains a data test T referencing A. If T is false, dbt should not fail, but instead wait until T realization, and then run B model and downstream models in the same B's partition.

So dbt run could have an ""infinite"" behaviour mode : each processor doing an endless loop of its DAG partition, applying any wait condition at each model execution. Data tests used in a model's `require` config that are referencing only same partition's models would behave as standard require tests.

We could even add source freshness to the list of waiting conditions.

* Dagster seems to have better UI and tools for debugging data pipelines locally. This is hugely beneficial as data pipelines grow more complex.
* Prefect has better cloud operations and less maintenance with native Prefect Cloud service, which is appreciated. We're happy to pay some premium for less work in maintenance.

I've been at the same crossroads just weeks ago, and your thoughts are spot on. It was a tough call, but we ultimately went with Dagster, mostly due to superior tooling (Dagit) + flexible programming model + community. I honestly thing you'll make a good decision either way, but for us it just seemed like Dagster ""thinks"" holistically about the process and challenges of making data applications, whereas Prefect solves for developing and executing pipelines in a very ergonomic way, but it's not as complete.

I saw this post from Nick Schrock on the Dagster slack community, that I think gets at the core of the difference between them:

> Dagster pipelines are more structured and constrained. This allows us have a lot of additional features (a type system, a config management system, a system-managed context object that flows through the compute, among other things). By constrast Prefect pipelines are more minimal and dynamic.
> Another way of framing this difference is that dagster is very interested in what the computations are doing rather than only how they are doing it. We consider ourselves the application layer for data applications (rich metadata, type system, structured events with semantic meaning etc), whereas prefect frames their software in terms of “negative” and “positive” engineering. This negative/positive framing is more exclusively about the “how” of pipelines: retries, operational matters etc.",8

1873,"using-dbt-artifacts-to-track-project-performance","For those who attended Coalesce, I gave a talk called “Analytics on your analytics” (watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqyxHCHH0d4)) where I discuss how Drizly is using dbt metadata to improve our dbt run operations and processes. I wanted to provide a more in depth guide to how we implemented using run_results with Dagster and Snowflake (more than I could cover in a 25 minute talk). I’d love to hear about others who have implemented a similar approach, or how you’re accomplishing the same thing with other tools. Definitely comment below with any examples!

**Tracking dbt model performance**

As our dbt DAG became more complicated we realized that we needed a more sophisticated orchestration tool to handle the execution of our runs, macros and tests we perform with each production run. We decided to use [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) because of its flexibility, strong emphasis on parameterization and ability to support users across our data team (analysts, data scientists, data engineers). Dagster offers a [dbt library](https://dagster.io/blog/dagster-dbt) for the execution of the dbt commands, coupled with [assets](https://docs.dagster.io/overview/asset-materializations) to track dbt artifacts produced with each run. However for more detailed reporting on our runs we wanted the ability to layer our dbt run metadata with all the other data in our warehouse. To do that we needed to ingest the metadata for each run.

**dbt audits V1: Inserting records**

Our first attempt to solve the logging problem was just to include [pre and post hooks](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/hooks-operations/) in dbt that performed inserts into an audits table before and after each run on production (inspired by the [event-logging](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-event-logging) package). This ensured that our models and the metadata ingested were tightly coupled, even if the run was performed by an automated process or an analyst performing an ad hoc run via the CLI.

**But there were downsides:**

* **The process was inefficient for the database**: With about 472 models, this equated to at least 944 inserts per dbt run, significantly slowing down our dbt runs. One of the reasons for this project was to be able to prioritize models for optimization so that we could speed up our runs, so this took us further away from that goal.

* **The data was not as rich as we wanted**: we were missing details about model errors, error messages, models that skipped, model tags, and more.

* **We weren’t able to capture errors**: Iif the model failed, the post-hook wouldn’t execute, and we’d have no record of the model failure

*dbt_project.yml*
```

models:

project:

pre-hook:

- ""{{ audit_model_logging(event_type='START') }}""

post-hook:

- ""{{ audit_model_logging(event_type='END') }}""

```

*macro.sql*

```

{% macro audit_model_logging(event_type) %}

{% if target.name == ""prod"" or var('override_logging') == True %}

{% call statement('audit', fetch_result=False) %}

-- Meta insert

INSERT INTO {{target.database}}.audits.model_logging

SELECT

AND table_schema = UPPER('{{ this.schema }}')

AND table_name = UPPER('{{ this.table }}')

) info_schema

ON 1 = 1

{%- endcall %}

{% endif %}

{% endmacro %}

```

**dbt audits V2: Using run_results.json**

After talking with Claire Carroll and Jeremy Cohen (teamwork!) about our process, they gave us the wonderful advice to try out using run_results.json. We moved away from individual post hooks and instead uploaded the dbt artifact to S3 after every run which would then be ingested into our warehouse with Snowpipe. Now using Dagster, it was easy to add one additional node to our DAG to run immediately after the dbt run occurred. The Dagster UI also became a better interface for analysts to perform ad hoc runs. Using presets we could define a preconfigured template for analysts to run specific models on production while still ensuring that subsequent steps such as ingesting the metadata always occurred.

![|339x528](upload://fWDkNG8bh9AOlXBVSh1fHb6ruOt.png)

*presets.py*
```

ad_hoc = PresetDefinition(

name=""ad_hoc"",

run_config=ad_hoc_run_config,

mode=""prod"",

solid_selection=[""run_model+""],

)

```

**Step 1: Upload run_results to S3**

As I described above, for this step we created an extra step (or solid) in Dagster to upload run_results.json to S3 after our dbt run is complete.

* If anyone knows how to do this with other orchestration tools, let us know in the comments.

**Step 2: Load S3 files into your data warehouse (in our case, Snowflake)**

Using Snowflake, this is accomplished using a Snowpipe that triggers when the new file hits our S3 bucket. The new data will append onto the table each time it’s triggered so we can retain history of our runs.

* This should also be possible with other data warehouses, such as BigQuery and Redshift. Let us know how you accomplish this with those tools.

**Step 3: Create dbt models**

Once we had run_results in Snowflake, and taking advantage of Snowflake’s support for semi structured data, we could easily create a dbt model that flattens the JSON and parses out the data points we were interested in. run_results.json contains a lot of rich metadata that allows us to track model run times, errors, error messages, tags, and more!

*dbt_modeling.sql*
```

{{

config(

materialized='view'

)

}}

WITH run_results AS (

SELECT

  created_at::DATE AS run_date,

  parse_json(event):results AS contents

FROM {{ ref('run_results') }}

)

SELECT

  run_date,

  r.value:node:resource_type::STRING AS node_type,

  r.value:node:unique_id::STRING AS node_unique_id,

  r.value:node:alias::STRING AS model_name,

  r.value:node:database::STRING AS database_name,

  r.value:node:schema::STRING AS schema_name,

  r.value:node:full_refresh::STRING AS was_full_refresh,

  r.value:node:tags AS model_tags,

  r.value:node:refs AS model_references,

  r.value:node:depends_on:macros AS dependent_macros,

  r.value:node:depends_on:nodes AS dependent_nodes,

  r.value:node:config:materialized::STRING AS materialization,

  r.value:node:config:enabled::STRING AS is_enabled,

  r.value:execution_time::FLOAT AS model_run_time_sec,

  r.value:status::STRING AS run_status,

  run_status = 'ERROR' AS was_error,

  CASE

    WHEN was_error = TRUE

    THEN r.value:error::STRING

  END AS error_message,

  r.value:skip::BOOLEAN AS was_skipped,

  r.value:warn::BOOLEAN AS was_warning,

  r.value:timing[1]:started_at::TIMESTAMP AS execute_started_at,

  r.value:timing[1]:completed_at::TIMESTAMP AS execute_completed_at,

  r.value AS json_blob

FROM run_results,

  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => contents) r

WHERE r.value:node:resource_type::STRING = 'model'

```

Another use case for this data, is to monitor our model freshness. Either because a model did not run or cases where a model is renamed or deleted, but the table is not dropped from snowflake. We created a stale_models dbt model for this use case, which joins in the dbt_modeling model above, with some snowflake metadata from the information schema.

*stale_models.sql*
```

{{

config(

materialized='view'

)

}}

WITH model_build AS (

SELECT DISTINCT

  info.table_catalog AS database_name,

  info.table_schema AS schema_name,

  info.table_name AS table_name,

  models.execute_completed_at AS audit_timestamp,

  info.last_altered

FROM prod.information_schema.tables info --must reference PROD for accurate results

LEFT JOIN {{ ref('dbt_modeling') }} models

  ON info.table_schema = UPPER(models.schema_name)

  AND info.table_name = UPPER(models.model_name)

)

SELECT

  database_name,

  schema_name,

  table_name,

  MAX(audit_timestamp) AS model_last_built,

  MAX(last_altered) AS table_last_altered,

  DATEDIFF(DAYS, table_last_altered, NVL(model_last_built, CURRENT_DATE)) AS days_stale

FROM model_build

-- Exclude certain schemas
WHERE schema_name NOT IN (

'AUDITS',

'INFORMATION_SCHEMA'

)

GROUP BY 1,2,3

```

**Step 4: Visualize the data/build a dashboard**

To visualize this data, and make it accessible to the rest of our analytics team, we created a Looker dashboard which contains views that show our current day run stats, run errors, model run times, model run time trends, and stale models. We also complement this with some snowflake data on our dbt warehouse credit usage trends. This gives our team a one stop shop for all dbt run questions, and allows us to easily track errors as well as which models may need a reactor or optimization work. We were also able to set up alerting through the Looker dashboard, which will send an alert to our #analytics_alerts Slack channel if the model error count increases above zero, for example.

Thank you!",1
1946,"incremental-model-use-db-cluster-column","Hi,
I have no idea on how to add such date logic to the generated dbt code - indeed, writing an custom materialization should be possible.
But,I would say in case of big tables you need to cluster the data for the right purpose, and if there are two purposes for the data set in mind, then split the data set in multiple tables per purpose. In this case I could imagine a following way of doing:
have  a main table containing time invariant fields maintained with inserts only, clustered by your date field (for downstream consumption reason), then have a secondary table clustered by order-id where you maintain your order-updates. Downstream consuming should then of course make use of join logic - but then again the join logic makes use of the clustering key in the secondary table.

And, now that I am writing my first idea, I come to think of another one, that might work. I conclude/assume  that your clustering key is currently the order_dt. What if you introduce a replacing unique key based on a combination of order_dt and order_id , like a concatenation of the two (date field first). Your filter key for downstream consuming will still be order_dt, but that field would be equally nicely clustered as the actual new cluster key.

Well I could not say which one would work better. The second one, I believe, comes the closest to your intended addition of a date filter logic.

As last comment, I would like to say that I personally favour a principle like 'inserts-only' DWH. So I would investigate solutions like separating time variant fields from the time invariant fields (like Data Vault does - all tables insert-only) and joining them during downstream consumption.

1946,"incremental-model-use-db-cluster-column","Hi there,
We used BigQuery but I can't see that the basic idea would change. 
Our solution as to get a list of partition values to add to the MERGE statement.

* We needed the code to be dynamic, easily used by any incremental model, with a unique key. 
* We needed to know the partition field name and the source of the distinct values

2043,"how-to-implement-dynamic-data-masking-on-redshift","Ashley Van Name from JetBlue gave an [excellent talk at Coalesce talk](https://www.getdbt.com/coalesce/agenda/securing-data-at-scale-with-dbt--snowflake) that shares how JetBlue was able to secure their data using dbt in combination with a Snowflake feature, [dynamic data masking](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-column-ddm-intro.html).

The nice thing about the Snowflake feature is that the policy is applied at run time — regardless of whether the underlying data is stored as a table or view.

For those of us not on Snowflake, it begs the question — what options do we have? How can we apply column-level policies to make sure our data is secure? Here is our recommended approach for Redshift users, would love to know if the same approach can be used by BigQuery users too!

# Part 1: Understanding data masking logic

In essence, we want to run logic that masks data depending on who is running the query. We can achieve this with a case statement, the current_user() function, and the `md5` function:

```
select
 case current_user()
   when 'admin' then birthday
   else md5(birthday)
 end as masked_birthday,
 ...

from ...

```

If we encode this logic into a view definition, when a user named `admin` selects from this view, they will see someone’s birthday, whereas anyone else will see an obfuscated value.

```
create view dbt_dave.users as (
  select
   case current_user()
     when 'admin' then birthday
     else md5(birthday)
   end as masked_birthday,
   ...

  from …
)
```

It’s important to note that if you were to create this model as a table instead, the value would get hard-coded depending on who ran the `create table as` statement, thereby removing the “dynamic” aspect of this approach.

# Part 2: Implementing this logic in a dbt project

Step 1. Turn the logic into a macro

Since we will probably want to use this logic in multiple places, it’s worth turning it into a macro:
```
{% macro mask_column(column_name) %}

 case current_user()
   when 'admin' then {{ column_name }}
   else md5({{ column_name }})
 end as {{ column_name }}
 
{% endmacro %}
```

Step 2, Take 1: Incorporate it into a model (that’s materialized as a view)

At first, we called the logic in models where we needed to mask data:
```
{{ config(materialized=’view’) }}
select
  {{ mask_column(‘first_name’) }} as first_name,
  {{ mask_column(‘last_name’) }} as last_name,
  favorite_bagel_flavor
from {{ ref(‘employees’) }}
```
This worked, but there was no safeguard against someone building this model as a table. We considered working around this by raising an exception if a non-view materialization was called, but that only solved half the problem - if a downstream model was materialized as a table, it would undo our good work. Further, it would be hard to manage our permissions correctly if both sensitive and masked data lived in the views and tables within the same.

It instead seemed cleaner to figure out a way to create a view with the masking logic on top of our model,  in a separate schema, and only expose that schema to our end users.

Step 2, Take 2: Views on top of models

For each model that we need to apply data masking to, we want to create a view that masks any PII columns, in a separate schema. So, we created a macro that takes two arguments — the schema we want to materialize the view in, and the columns we deem to be PII. We also need to first create the schema if it doesn’t yet exist.

```

{% macro create_data_masked_view(schema, columns_to_mask) %}
   {% if execute %}
  
   {# get all columns in the relation #}
  
       {% set model_cols = adapter.get_columns_in_relation(this) %}
      
       {# create Relation object for masked view #}
      
       {%- set masked_view = api.Relation.create(
             database=this.database,
             schema=schema,
             identifier=this.identifier) -%}
            
       {# create schema #}
      
       {% do adapter.create_schema(masked_view) %}
      
       {# create masked view in new schema for sensitive columns #}
      
       {% set view_sql %}
 
           create view {{ masked_view }} as (
 
               select
                   {% for col in model_cols %}
                       {% if col.name in columns_to_mask %}
                       {{ mask_column(col.name) }} as {{ col.name }}
                       {% else %}
                       {{ col.name }}
                       {% endif %}
                       {{ "","" if not loop.last }}
                   {% endfor %}
               from {{ this }}
           )
 
       {% endset %}
      
       {% do run_query(view_sql) %}
      
       {% do dbt_utils.log_info(""Masked view created at: "" ~  masked_view ) %}
      
   {% endif %}
  
   select 1=1
  
{% endmacro %}

```

Since we need to run this after a model is created, post-hooks come in really handy here:

```
{{
   config(
       post_hook=""{{ create_data_masked_view(
           schema='public_analytics',
           columns_to_mask=['first_name', 'last_name']
       ) }}""
   )
}}
 
select
...
```

We put together an example project [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-labs-experimental-features/tree/dynamic-data-masking-redshift/dynamic-data-masking-redshift), which you can clone and try out yourself!


Step 3: Granting Redshift permissions

The last step here is to grant permissions on the views in each schema to the users who should/should not be able to view the protected data. This would look something like:

```
-- analysts get access to the schema with our masked view
grant all on schema public_analytics to group analysts;
grant select on all views in schema public_analytics to group analysts;

-- admins get access to the private schema with unmasked PHI
grant all on schema private_analytics to group admins;
grant select on all views in schema private_analytics to group admins;
```
# Additional considerations
- This same approach could be implemented as a UDF within Redshift rather than a macro. The same case statement logic could be defined as a custom function, and referenced in the dbt code directly. More on UDFs here. 
- This should be extensible to Big Query. Rather than the current_user() variable, Big Query has a session_user() variable that can be referenced. We haven’t done any testing on this, but theoretically it should work in the same way!
- We use a simple md5 function to mask the data, but there are other, more secure ways of hashing. As discussed in this related article, as well as Ashley’s talk, you can incorporate a “salt” value to add deterministically-random numbers to the database values prior to hashing to improve the security of the PHI data. Alternatively, you could use sha rather than md5. 
- We chose to maintain the list of users who get access to the PHI directly in the macro. For simplicity of updating, this could be maintained as a project variable referenced in the macro, and the macro itself wouldn’t need ongoing maintenance. 
- Additionally, rather hardcoding the list of users with access to the protected schema, you could follow specific naming conventions for your Redshift users, and reference those in the macro. For example, all users in the `admins` user group could have the prefix `admin_` on their username, and then the logic could look like:

```
select
 case 
   when current_user() ilike 'admin_%' 
      then birthday
   else md5(birthday)
 end as masked_birthday,
 ...

from ...
```

Alternative approaches:

- This dynamic masking could also be done at the column level in your BI tool. If you’re using something like Looker, you can use their user attributes functionality to dynamically allow users to see the PHI in the underlying data tables. This is a little more difficult to maintain, as you’d need to write the logic directly into the column definition of each field of interest, and ensure that only views are connected to your BI tool. We feel like this is more easily managed in the transform layer, but it can certainly be done here too!",1
2043,"how-to-implement-dynamic-data-masking-on-redshift","This is awesome! Great writeup @dave.connors. 

Had you considered using the [meta property](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/meta/#designate-a-source-column-as-containing-pii) on columns to tag your columns as containing PII instead of hardcoding the list of columns in each place?",2
2043,"how-to-implement-dynamic-data-masking-on-redshift","Hey @joellabes ! 

This is a fantastic question, and one we probably should have considered earlier on! :sweat_smile:

The meta property can absolutely be used to tag columns as PHI/PII, like the example in the docs site.  This column property is available in the [`column` object](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-classes#column), and can be referenced in the macro jinja. 

@claire  took a swing at an updated version of this macro on [this branch](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-labs-experimental-features/commit/c12401064f2dc12278fd4a69a2e12fa3562a2687). This version does not accept `columns_to_mask` as an argument in the macro, and instead relies on a PII `meta` tag in the `schema.yml` configuration. Otherwise, it works exactly the same, and doesn't require any updating of the post hook! Super elegant!

The choice between the original version and this `meta` version will depend on where you want the complexity of tagging PII columns to live. You can either have slightly more complex `post_hook` logic to directly specify the columns to mask, or slightly more complicated `schema.yml` files. 

Thanks again for the suggestion Joel!",3
2043,"how-to-implement-dynamic-data-masking-on-redshift","Another approach, assuming each user querying the database is using their own user (including on Looker, leveraging parametrized connections) rather than a service account, you could use the ABAC (attribute-based access control) pattern.

It requires maintaining a table containing users and attributes. You then join that attribute table to the table on which you want to apply security within a view, and only expose the view to the user.

Here's a SQLFiddle demonstrating row-level security AND dynamic data masking based on the user querying the table.

2079,"orchestrating-fivetran-and-dbt-with-airflow","In the dbt community, a common question that comes up is how to sync dbt runs with one’s extract and loader tool. Fivetran connectors and dbt jobs are one particularly common pairing that comes up, and Analytics Engineers typically face a choice in how to orchestrate the two. On the one hand, the load and transform steps can be scheduled and run independently. Alternatively, they can be linked into an event-driven workflow. Airflow is a great tool for creating and running this type of workflow. Setting up a system to trigger and manage events increases the complexity at first, however there are benefits that make the results worth the time spent. In particular, we’ve observed several concerns raised in the [dbt Slack community](https://community.getdbt.com/):

* There are a large number of related load and transform jobs, making it difficult to manage their separate schedules. This can be particularly painful when a transformation job depends on multiple upstream data loaders. See this [thread](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C0VLZM3U2/p1559567039041700).
* You want to pass parameters to the DAG run based on the outcome of the data loader(s). See this [thread](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C0VLZM3U2/p1541412766068100).
* It’s valuable to reduce overall latency of the load + transform process due to downstream operational dependencies. These might include supplying fresh data for a machine learning model to consume, or reporting SLA requirements.

If these factors are not a high priority, then it’s completely valid to use scheduled processes. However, many of the larger organizations (2,000+ employees) that @amy and I work with as members of the Solutions Architecture team at Fishtown view these as high-priority items. In that case, event-driven architectures like the one we describe in this article are key.

**Summary of Approach**

Our goal is to present a simplified, linear workflow and illustrate how to coordinate tasks using the [Fivetran](https://fivetran.com/docs/rest-api) and [dbt Cloud](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api/) APIs with Airflow [XComs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html?highlight=xcom#concepts-xcom). Note that an organization using dbt Core could accomplish a very similar workflow using the Airflow Bash Operator to trigger a dbt run. Our friends at [Astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/) have a great series of blog posts featuring orchestration of dbt Core with Airflow. See [part 1](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/airflow-dbt-1) and [part 2](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/airflow-dbt-2). That said, there are some additional benefits to using dbt Cloud. These include the ability to run Pull Request checks with dbt Test independently of Airflow use.

**With this setup we have:**

* Isolation between the data loading (Fivetran), transformation (dbt) and orchestration (Airflow) functions in the stack
* Minimal re-work on the Airflow side as the dbt transformation and Fivetran processes grow in complexity over time
* Leveraged dbt’s native ability to parallelize job runs.

**What you need to get started**

You can find the codebase we implemented in writing this article [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/airflow-fivetran-dbt). To be clear, we didn’t seek to implement a complete production-ready system for this task, but rather to create a starting point.

**To implement this yourself, at a minimum you will need access to the following:**

* Fivetran API Key and API Secret. These are encoded into an api token in base64. The format is api-key:api-secret. [This link](https://fivetran.com/docs/rest-api/getting-started) documents how to create this value yourself.
* dbt Cloud API key. Navigate to Profile > API Access from the dbt Cloud console to generate this.
* Snowflake database to accept data loads and run the transforms.
* The dbt Cloud Account ID, which is used in the API calls to dbt Cloud.
* Access to a Google Cloud Platform account to host the Airflow server.

**Dataset and use case**

We used a publicly available dataset on [Pokemon](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) for this exercise, saved in a Google Sheet. Our use case is to use dbt to aggregate the average HP score across pokemon catches. Your dbt transformation process could evolve substantially while keeping this same architecture in place.

**Solution Architecture**

![|624x453](upload://lkUFpsKKxOR4zPhLkjfRbRGYKYP.png)

**Hosting the Airflow server**

We hosted the Airflow server on a virtual machine running in a VPC within [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/). We followed Jostein Leira’s excellent [Airflow setup guide](https://medium.com/grensesnittet/airflow-on-gcp-may-2020-cdcdfe594019) to get the Airflow server up and running.

** We recommend using a tool like [Astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/), a managed Airflow interface, if you want the convenience of a user-friendly interface like dbt Cloud and Fivetran.

**Version controlling Airflow and dbt**

We used two git repositories - one for the [Airflow code and server setup](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/airflow-fivetran-dbt) and one for the [dbt Project](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/airflow-fivetran-dbt--dbt-jobs). Though it would be possible to combine them into a single repository, having separate codebases for dbt and Airflow reflects how each system is functionally separate in our architecture.

**Setting up data loads**

For this use case, we used Fivetran’s [google sheet connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/files/google-sheets) to run the data loads. In the event you aren’t using Fivetran for data loading, that element of the solution would change to either 1) use the API for a different data loading tool or 2) Code the data loading function into the Python Operators running in the Airflow DAG.

**Data transformation process in dbt**

Our dbt models are illustrated below. Agg_pokedex_summary is the final table we want to surface in the analytics layer of the warehouse.

![|624x292](upload://eKPckb5qZ5wFSMCCYZnKITYfWXq.png)

This is clearly a simplistic DAG. In our case, we are focused on the relationship between the data loader and the transformation more so than the complexity of the transformation itself.

**Orchestration process in Airflow**

The Airflow DAG is illustrated below.

![|624x176](upload://5pdoBfNYn24SCy7S7TmaUCqbAx0.png)

The input to this Airflow DAG is a simple mapping of the Fivetran connector_id and matching dbt job name:

> {
> 
> ""connector_id"": ""warn_enormously"",
> 
> ""dbt_job_name"": ""pokemon_aggregation_job""
> 
> }

These values are stored in the `dag_run` configuration within each Python Operator in the Airflow process. They can be accessed in code like this:

`connector_id = kwargs[‘dag_run’].conf[‘fivetran_connector_id’]`

**Communicating between Airflow tasks**

Communication of state across Airflow tasks can be accomplished using [XComs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html?highlight=xcom#concepts-xcom). By default, tasks in Airflow execute in separate runtimes, and don’t share variables. So, we can’t declare a variable in one task and pass it to a downstream task without writing that data to a common storage location. XComs are a convenient way to accomplish this in Airflow. As your use cases grow more complex, these object types are especially useful for developing conditional logic in your pipeline. For example, you could trigger a subsection of the dbt dag using the [model selection syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax/) based on the results of prior Airflow tasks.

For example, in the ‘dbt_job’ task we can add elements for each task like so:

> run_id = trigger_resp['id']
> 
> kwargs['ti'].xcom_push(key='dbt_run_id', value=str(run_id))

And in downstream tasks such as ‘get_dbt_job_run_status’, we are able to extract them:

> ti = kwargs['ti']
> 
> run_id = ti.xcom_pull(key='dbt_run_id', task_ids='dbt_job')

With each of these elements in place, we have what’s needed to do things such as extracting the dbt job run status from the dbt Cloud API. The dbt run_id and account_id elements become variables in a GET request to the dbt Cloud endpoint.

https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/v2/accounts/{accountId}/runs/{runId}/

**Comparison to other approaches**

It’s important to note that the solution we present here isn’t the only way to organize this type of process. We’ve spoken with a few dbt users who use Airflow to extract and rebuild the dbt DAG, *then* run each dbt model using the extracted SQL. This provides the benefit of allowing Airflow’s ability to provide more sophisticated retry logic than dbt. In our opinion, isolating the system that handles orchestration (Airflow) from the transformer (dbt) makes the overall process easier to understand and maintain. Plus, as the dbt DAG grows, using Airflow to extract and build the DAG introduces additional maintenance overhead to ensure the DAG reconstruction goes smoothly and that the runs are parallelized intelligently.

**How to build this yourself**

For further details on how we implemented this, please see the README file, Airflow code, and environment setup shell scripts in [this repository](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/airflow-fivetran-dbt). A real deployment would very likely include additional logic to enable retries and conditional execution flow in the Airflow DAG. Use this as a guide for how one could coordinate between data loading and transformation functions.

**What do you think?**

Our opinion is that this simple setup plays to the unique strengths of both Airflow and dbt:

* Airflow focuses on scheduling and process flow
* dbt - deployed as dbt Cloud in our example - handles the meat of the data transformation

What aren’t we thinking about that you think should be considered here? We would love to continue the discussion with you!",1

2160,"dbt-model-think-unit-tests-poc","Hello! I recently read https://shopify.engineering/build-production-grade-workflow-sql-modelling which describes Shopify's approach to testing in dbt. 

At my day job, we've been using dbt for a couple of months now. We've been planning on providing some sort of targeted ""unit"" testing framework, which allows users to validate an individual model's logic. I took a stab at it this weekend and wanted to solicit some feedback on the approach. This is packaged as a dbt package, but it's not a package announcement. This is a barely working testing framework that just supports postgres :p 

I defined the following design constraints:
- Tests must be written as python tests (your standad test_*.py files, using python test classes). This allows end users to choose their python framework and reporting methods. It should be very familiar to anyone using python.
- Tests should support assertions using pandas dataframes. Pandas makes it easy to create relational constructs, and to transforms dataframes into sql tables and vice-a-versa
- Tests should provide any easy way to mock model dependencies, i.e. ref and source. Tests should only focus on a single model's transformations and not a dependency graph of models. 
- The test strategy should not require model definitions to change in any way. This means no conditionals, or special calls. The test framework should evaluate the model as close as possible to the definition that will be running in production.

The POC framework is available here:

https://github.com/dm03514/dbt-model-tests

Following shows an MVP of usage.

The POC initialized a new dbt project. I then created 2 tests, one for each of the ""example"" models. Each of the tests live alongside the models:

```
models/example/
  my_first_dbt_model.sql
  my_second_dbt_model.sql
  test_my_first_dbt_model.py
  test_my_second_dbt_model.py
```

The first example model looks like:

```
# my_first_dbt_model.sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

with source_data as (

    select 1 as id
    union all
    select null as id

)

select *
from source_data
```
Notice that it contains no dependencies (no refs or sources).

This is a pretty simple case. The test framework uses dbts own ""adapters"" to get a connection to the database specified in the config file.

Currently, it assumes a static config file used for testing, located in the conf/ directory.

The lack of dependencies makes this test really simple:

```
import pandas as pd

from dbtmodeltest.testcase import DBTModelTestCase


class MyFirstDBTModelTestCase(DBTModelTestCase):

    def test_output_rows(self):
        df = pd.DataFrame([
            (1,),
            (None,)
        ], columns=['id'])

        out_df = self.execute_model(
            model='models/example/my_first_dbt_model.sql',
        )

        self.assertDFEqual(df, out_df)
```


```

The second test gets much more complicated.
The second test exercises the `my_second_dbt_model.sql` which looks like:

```
select *
from {{ ref('my_first_dbt_model') }}
where id = 1
```

The test framework needs to hook into the `ref` tag and replace it with a pandas dataframe. The test for this looks like:

```
import pandas as pd

from dbtmodeltest.testcase import DBTModelTestCase


class MyFirstDBTModelTestCase(DBTModelTestCase):
    def test_only_returns_id_1(self):
        my_first_dbt_model = pd.DataFrame([
            (1,),
            (2,),
            (None,)
        ], columns=['id'])

        out_df = self.execute_model_with_refs(
            model='models/example/my_second_dbt_model.sql',
            my_first_dbt_model=my_first_dbt_model,
        )

            (1,),
        ], columns=['id'])

        self.assertDFEqual(expected_df, out_df)
```

This shows the output from the test execution:

The strategy for replacing ""ref"" with custom data leverages a custom macro. This macro prefixes the table with a prefix defined in the environment:

```
{% macro ref(model_name) %}
  {% set dbt_model_test_enabled = env_var('DBT_MODEL_TEST_ENABLED', False) %}
  {# set dbt_model_test_database = env_var('DBT_MODEL_TEST_DATABASE', '') #}
  {# set dbt_model_test_schema = env_var('DBT_MODEL_TEST_SCHEMA', '') #}
  {% set dbt_model_test_identifier_prefix = env_var('DBT_MODEL_TEST_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX', '') %}

  {{ log(""Running custom:ref "" ~ model_name) }}

  {% if dbt_model_test_enabled == '1' %}
    {{ log(""DBT_MODEL_TEST: model test enabled"") }}
    {% set rel = builtins.ref(model_name) %}
    {%
      set newrel = rel.replace_path(
        identifier=dbt_model_test_identifier_prefix + model_name
      )
    %}
    {% do return(newrel) %}
  {% else %}
    {{ log(""DBT_MODEL_TEST: model test disabled"") }}
    {% do return(builtins.ref(model_name)) %}
  {% endif %}
{% endmacro %}
```

This points our dbt model to the prefixed test table. The final step is to create the prefixed test table using the dataframe provide. 

```

I'm wondering:
- Does replacing ref/source with a custom macro make sense? 
- Has anyone else done this?
- If so, which strategy did you use? 


I appreciate any feedback on this approach. Thank you.",1

2160,"dbt-model-think-unit-tests-poc","[dm03514](https://discourse.getdbt.com/u/dm03514), this is exactly what i was looking for!!

I had a very similar path to you where I disliked the jinja-heavy dbt unit tests and thought using python as the testing layer would be a much better solution.  I was glad to see shopify already implemented something and proved it out.

Have you continued with this POC?  Is your team using your current strategy?  Or continuing without unit tests?

To answer your questions:
* I think monkey-patching `ref` and `source` are totally fine in this context.
* One idea: could you put the `{% if dbt_model_test_enabled == '1' %}` around the `{% macro ref(model_name) %}`, so the `ref macro` only gets redefined in test runs?  If so, this would allow you to remove the `{% else %}` block, but more importantly your `ref` monekypatch wouldn't impact production runs at all.

Related: Trying to ""unit test dbt models within dbt"" sounds nice, but I think it makes the tests hard to write and hard to read/interpret.   Jumping up a layer to python totally makes sense.  It reminds me of in the Ruby on Rails world, we would write ""html view tests"", where we'd render our html views, then have tests which look at the output string and start making assertions against it (not in a browser, just in ruby).  These tests turned out to be extremely hard to write, hard to see what was being tested, and provided very little value.  So... the community went a layer up and tested things as ""features"" via selenium/browser.  I see a lot similarities between trying to unit test dbt models with dbt vs unit test dbt models with python in a mini pipeline.",3
2287,"writing-models-backwards-an-unorthodox-approach-to-data-transformation","I was recently pairing with an early-career analyst who asked me for help debugging a query she had written. The problem she had to solve was similar to this:
> A company has two newsletters that people can subscribe to — for the sake of this conversation, let's call them ""The Daily"" and ""The Weekly"".
>
> Each month, we want to know:
> * How many people that were members of the Daily, subscribed to the Weekly?
> * How many people that were members of the Weekly, subscribed to the Daily?

Earlier in my career, when thinking how to solve this problem, my first instinct would have been to look at the data we had available, and start writing queries — after all, you have to build your DAG from left to right, right?

Now, I take a backwards approach, and write the final query first.

Vid here:
https://www.loom.com/share/d77560469b0b43ba95877bcf46d89da1

and the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1umsRK_3plthWX966KwKeVxhWpertQwbnkTDk50vLKUg/edit#gid=0).

## Step 1: Go to [sheets.new](sheets.new) to create a new Google Sheet
_(Did you know that this is a valid URL? RIP my Google Drive, which is now full of `Untitled Sheet`s)_

## Step 2: Mock out the final report you're trying to build, by entering values into the sheet.

For us, this looked like the following:
| subscription_month | weekly_subscribers_to_daily | daily_ subscribers_to_weekly |
|-|-|-|
| Jan 2021 | 100 | 150 |
| Feb 2022 | 120 | 160 |

^ These numbers don't have to be reflective of real numbers _at all_, and the column names don't even have to be perfect at this point.

## Step 3. Mock the query that would produce this table
You might also simultaneously mock out the table you're selecting from to write this query.

This is where things got tricky for us. At first, we thought we'd be selecting from a table with one record per subscriber:

`subscribers`: one record per subscriber
| subscriber_id |  date_subscribed_to_daily |  date_subscribed_to_weekly | 
|---------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------| 
| 1             | 2021-01-01                 | 2021-01-08                  | 
| 2             | 2021-02-07                 |                             | 
| 3             | 2021-03-18                           | 2021-03-14                  | 

But when we went to write the query, we realized we had a problem – what field would we `date_trunc` on?
```sql
select
  date_trunc('month', ????) as subscription_month,
  count(???) as weekly_subscribers_to_daily,
  count(???) as daily_ subscribers_to_weekly
 
from subscribers

group by 1

```

## Step 4. Iterate
From here, we realized the model that we were selecting from needed to be one record per _subscription_ — a particular subscriber (human being) can appear twice. Our query was going to look something like this:

```sql
select
  date_trunc('month', subscription_date) as subscription_month,
  count(case when was_previously_subscribed_to_weekly and newsletter = 'daily' then subscriber_id end) as weekly_subscribers_to_daily,
  count(case when was_previously_subscribed_to_daily and newsletter = 'weekly' then subscriber_id end) as daily_subscribers_to_weekly
 
from subscribers

group by 1

```
^ Note that we also filled in some more of our `count` logic here, which lets us know ""ok we need to make sure our upstream model has fields like `newsletter` and `was_previously_subscribed_to_daily` etc.

Now our mock table gets updated to:
`subscriptions`: one record per subscriber, per newsletter they are subscribed to
| subscriber_id | date_subscribed | newsletter | was_previously_subscribed_to_daily | was_previously_subscribed_to_weekly | 
|---------------|-----------------|------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------| 
| 1             | 2021-01-01      | daily      | FALSE                              | FALSE                               | 
| 1             | 2021-01-08      | weekly     | TRUE                               | FALSE                               | 
| 2             | 2021-02-07      | daily      | FALSE                              | FALSE                               | 
| 3             | 2021-03-14      | weekly     | FALSE                              | FALSE                               | 
| 3             | 2021-03-18      | daily      | FALSE                              | TRUE                                | 


We can also take a guess as to what the SQL for those last two columns looks like, they're going to be some sort of window function, partitioned by the `subscriber_id`:
```sql
select
  subscriber_id,
  date_subscribed,
  newsletter,

  boolor_agg(newsletter = 'daily') over (
     partition by subscriber_id
     order by date_subscribed
     rows between unbounded preceding and current row
  ) as was_previously_subscribed_to_daily, 
  -- etc
from ???
```

## Step 5. Match this up with source data
So far, we've written pseudo-output and pseudocode without actually looking at our source data! At this point, we need to consider what the shape of our source data is! Do we have a table of subscriptions? Do the subscriptions to each newsletter live in separate tables (and therefore we need to `union` the data together)

## Step 6. Move the logic into your dbt project

Now that you've broken up the problem into smaller pieces, you can start moving this code into your dbt project! Sometimes the theoretical backwards-working is enough for me to start building my DAG from left-to-right. Sometimes though, it's not, and I need to work backwards in my dbt project too! In those cases, I'll often put placeholder columns in my models (especially if I'm adjusting existing models by adding a new column):
```
select
  ..., 
  null::boolean as was_previously_subscribed_to_daily

from ...
```

This approach has been met with mixed reactions internally — I'm curious, do you think this is a good approach, or more confusing than just writing the SQL?",1

2287,"writing-models-backwards-an-unorthodox-approach-to-data-transformation","Great writeup, Claire!

I think the most important part when starting something like this is to understand how *your* data needs to be structured in the end result for your stakeholder (i.e. having decent-enough requirements). So from that perspective, I always start at the end...but where I go from there depends on a few things. I think your Step 2 (mocking out the final report) is going to look different for people depending on where the BI calculations are done. What you currently have in there is essentially the end result of the report - but is that the end result of *your* code? It probably depends on where you're calculating the metrics - in the BI tool or the code itself. I might be wrong with this assumption, but I think most people currently have the calculations in the BI tool itself since it's more performant to e.g. apply date parameters to the dataset than it is to re-query the dataset with new date parameters. 

So for me personally, my Step 2 here would be to mock up what the end dataset is that I need to produce in order to support generating the calculated metrics that go into the report. Here are some questions I ask myself during this process (assuming the calculations are done in the BI tool):

* What are the metrics that need to go into the report? What level(s) of granularity (dimensions) are the final metrics reported at?
* For each final metric, what are the underlying fields that contribute to that metric's calculation?
* For each individual metric required to support the calculations, what dimensions are available to me and how do the dimensions at that level differ from the dimensionality needed in the final report or dataset?
* During this thought process, I also think about the operations that need to be applied to the metrics (e.g. SUM, AVG) and think about my GROUP BYs for dimensionality.

In order to answer these questions, you kinda need to start at the beginning of the DAG workflow to understand all the little pieces of data you have available.

I think where people (myself included) are potentially getting tripped up with this ""destination-first paradigm"" is writing the SQL queries at each stage. Think of it like putting together something from IKEA. You know what the end result needs to be. And if you start from the back of the instruction manual, you'll see that the final steps often require you to ~~screw~~ allen wrench something in that was assembled from individual components earlier on in the process. And so while it's great (necessary, I'd argue) to understand what those modular (assembled) components are that you need in the final steps, there's no way for me to actually build those without starting from the beginning, with the actual parts. Not to mention, the first thing you need to do with IKEA furniture is verify that you have all the necessary parts to be able to actually build the thing (aka initial data discovery).

If I were to change the process you've outlined to work better for me personally, I'd probably take out the writing SQL backwards part and instead focus on just modeling my data backwards. I'd want to understand what my data needs to look like at each stage, and once I have all the stages outlined, I'd start from the beginning (left side of the DAG) to start building towards those stages. I think there's also something to be said for failing early -- failing early doesn't only mean you fail quickly...it also relates to *where* you fail (i.e. early on in the data process). Point being, I'd rather fail in developing the initial building blocks vs. assuming I'll have certain building blocks in the end. Now, that might be a little confusing, but what I'm saying is - I can't assume the building blocks I need later on in the process will be built exactly the way I had outlined if I were writing the SQL backwards - there may be some nuances earlier on in the data process that would cause me to shift my entire approach.

Lastly, I wanted to touch on something you said early on in the article.

> Earlier in my career, when thinking how to solve this problem, my first instinct would have been to look at the data we had available, and start writing queries

First off - I think this is a testament to how much you've grown as a developer, as this, in my opinion, is the difference between junior and senior developers. Junior devs often take a problem and then sit down and start writing code, hoping that it'll play out for the best. Senior devs take a problem, then map/plan everything out before executing on their plan.",8

I found your post echoing with my recent experience.

We just onboarded dbt and I am now working on migrating our Postgres project with ~100 tables/views/materialised views to Redshift using dbt, with the goal of improving our schema design. As a newbie in analytics engineering (I am a data analyst), I had struggles at the beginning when I tried to design upstream models (dimension and fact tables) first as I was not so sure what we would need. 

Then I decided to start with cube models (an intermediate layer between dimensions & facts and reports), I copied the old SQL definition and start to clean up the code and logic. It was during this process that it became clear to me which parts of the old code should be decoupled, which are repeated across the project, and eventually what should be moved upstream/downstream.

So my current setup is that dbt is connected to a github repo and you can delete branches manually in github and/or set up that branches are deleted on merge.

If you delete all the branches here and then go for ""refresh git state"" in the dbt frontend, the old branches will disappear.

It also turned out to be a non issue because we are not really using the dbt webfrontend for development because it's pretty slow. Usually I just develop in visual studio code, created my branches there and push into the repo. Only some more testing is needed, I go to the dbt webfrotend, open my branch and test there.

> Would you recommend this process for all new team members?

I ask because this solution seems to ensure a stable environment at the expense of initial set up and overall complexity. Is a stable environment what you see new users struggle with the most. Does this solution assume that the new team members are already familiar with anaconda environments?

Even teaching anaconda to someone with only Data Viz and SQL experience is quite a heavy lift already. It was validating too see @aescay's post last week rationalizing virtualenv over conda envs:

[quote=""aescay, post:1, topic:2353""]
### Why `venv` ? Why not `pyenv-virtualenv` or `conda` ?

While it’s true that the other two alternatives (and many more) are likely better, all other alternatives require installing another package whereas `venv` comes shipped with the latest versions of Python out of the box. This makes it easy for us to use this across all your machines without having to worry about installing other bloatware that might not be useful to us. Keeping this as simple as possible will also help maintainability!

Unless your team uses dbt-cloud 100%, I would recommend this process (or one like it) for all team members and projects.

I would also argue that this process is actually supposed to make initial set up easier, rather than being an expense.  Before I started using containerized development environments (on non-dbt projects), I would spend half a day with a new team member just getting their local environment set up with the right version of python, pip packages, homebrew recipes, etc.  There was always a few things that worked on my machine a few months ago that no longer works with more recent packages, and that only gets worse as the project complexity and dependencies grow.  And later, making any sort of upgrades to our environment was just as difficult, and we would rarely be willing to go through the pain of upgrading our packages and end up missing out on nice new features or important bug fixes, and our code would just end up rotting.

I personally don't think setting up miniconda is too big of a lift.  After the initial setup, there's only one command you have know: `conda activate myenv`.  But I can see how virtualenv might be slightly simpler, especially if you're only going to be managing a single dbt project.",3

just getting their local environment set up with the right version of python, pip packages, homebrew recipes, etc.

We don't have any homebrew recipes, so for us, conda does all this for us. The big challenge I find is helping ensure that the conda env will activate for users automatically when they open the project in VSCode. Fortunately now the Python extension auto-activates if there's a requirements.txt file in the repo. The challenge is helping new users to set their `python.PythonPath` variable in the `settings.json`",4
2340,"a-containerized-dbt-environment-for-your-team","Some new users are able to follow directions in our repo `README.md` without any help, which is pretty similar to what is in the dbt-container-skeleton.  Others who are less familiar with working on the command line may need some handholding at first.  Most of the complexity is meant to wrapped up into simple invoke tasks (via `tasks.py`).

This setup is meant to be for _local_ development, so the container is built and run on the developer's laptop.  (Since the image is built on the developer's machine, there is a risk that the build process could differ slightly from dev to dev -- if that becomes an issue, then it would be prudent to build a workflow that involved hosting a main image on dockerhub and share that with your team, but I haven't found that to be really necessary).",5

That said, for our team, a light environment handler did the trick because it was rare that we had python (and other programming) dependencies floating around and in flux in our local machines. However, prior to working at Fishtown I was previously in a broader data team and we had a lot of Python and R projects that we were working on simultaneously. In that sort of environment, which is common for a lot of data teams whose resources are pulled in all different directions, I would highly recommend using something like conda (because it is more robust and worth the effort of having fully discrete Python environments), or even dockerizing environments (which gives you full flexibility and isolation, and was what we were using in our organization).

Our team at Palmetto Energy has also thought a lot about this problem this year. I looked through your repo and found that your approach to containerizing dbt is very similar to the approach my team has taken!

I wanted to share our package, [`palm`](https://github.com/palmetto/palm-cli), which we just open sourced (and my coworker Emily spoke about at Coalesce last week, the talk called ""Data Paradox of the Growth Stage Startup"").  Palm is a CLI for your CLIs,  that is to say a standardized interface for your multitudes of projects using a common set of customizable commands, which you can implement with custom logic for each project you work in, or share the same logic across projects with similar workflows via plugins.

We wrote a plugin for palm called [`palm-dbt`](https://github.com/palmetto/palm-dbt) which has the standard dbt commands built out, along with the ability to generate all the files necessary to containerize your project with a simple command (`palm containerize`). 

Our team also uses palm in 10+ other projects, including Airflow, Great Expectations, Terraform, and more. We don't have plugins for these written yet because dbt is by far our biggest use-case and our other projects have company-specific logic, but we hope the community at large will help us build out these plugins going forward as well! 

The `containerize` command is included with palm core, so it is available for use in other projects besides dbt. This has helped us tremendously with the Python version juggling issues that others have mentioned in this post. It has also enabled us to forego Python or other environment managers, virtual envs, etc. Just containerize and list dependencies for your project in the requirements file!

2353,"setting-up-your-local-dbt-run-environments","As an analytics engineer on Fishtown's professional services team, I spent the past year working on 10 different dbt projects for customers. I wrote the following guide to help our team easily switch back and forth between dbt versions. There were times when I was working on 2-4 different projects at once and it was cumbersome to operate in an ""all or nothing mentality"" regarding which dbt version I could work on. I also wanted to help make it easier to test out beta releases of dbt without having to fully commit to using the beta for *every* project I was actively working on. 

I wanted to share this document with you all since it might help your team if you're managing multiple dbt projects as well, or you'd like to easily test beta releases and keep up with the latest and greatest that dbt has to offer!

## TLDR

- If you've ever wanted to get multiple versions of dbt running in your machine (specifically the latest release and maybe the latest pre-release - beta or rc) then you've come to the right place!
- This guide will help you get set up with 2 virtual environments (using `venv`):
    1. dbt - latest official release
    2. dbt-beta - latest pre release

- This will help your team:
    1. **standardize development experience** - no more ""this works on mine but idk why it doesn't work on yours"" problem
    2. **easily upgrade and manage local dbt versions** - this should make it easier to both beta test new releases and easily swap back to existing stable releases when bugs are discovered

## Why should I bother?

### What are Virtual Environments?

Real Python does a great job at explaining what virtual environments are and why we need them in this primer (feel free to loop back to this later):

[Python Virtual Environments: A Primer - Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#managing-virtual-environments-with-virtualenvwrapper)

For now, the most important takeaway here is the concept of **project isolation**. Being able to isolate your projects allows you to install and handle multiple, potentially conflicting, package versions in one machine at the same time. 

### How will using Virtual Environments help your team?

In the same vein as having code style guides, organizing project directories consistently (using a `~/dev/` directory), and version controlling analytics, this is just another way to aid in improving the developer experience and preventing unexpected code breakage. Here are a couple ways it could benefit your team:

1. **Everyone will have the exact same local installation of dbt**, in an isolated environment, guaranteeing consistency across all your machines. No more ""I don't understand why it doesn't work on your machine, it works on mine 🤷‍♂️""
2. **You can now easily hot swap between dbt versions.** If you want to run the latest stable release, you can do so, if you want to easily try the same project on beta, you could do so also! All this with much fewer commands than those required to upgrade or downgrade dbt.
3. **We can have a script manage your environments and make updating easy!** If everyone has the same environments set up, it makes it really easy for people to build scripts to help manage that across all your machines. (And this is what we did here!) No need to remember to upgrade both the dbt stable release and also the beta, just run a simple command (like `dbt-update`) and voila, you have both environments updated!

### Why `venv`? Why not `pyenv-virtualenv` or `conda`?

While it's true that the other two alternatives (and many more) are likely better, all other alternatives require installing another package whereas `venv` comes shipped with the latest versions of Python out of the box. This makes it easy for us to use this across all your machines without having to worry about installing other bloatware that might not be useful to us. Keeping this as simple as possible will also help maintainability! 

## Count me in! Where do I get started?

If you're convinced this is the right solution, here's a quick guide to get you set up!

1. Copy the contents of this gist:
    - dbt-update.sh

        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash

        DBT_ENV=~/.virtualenvs/dbt
        DBT_BETA_ENV=~/.virtualenvs/dbt-beta

        process_environment() {
          env=$1

            read ans

            if [[ $ans == ""r"" ]]; then
              echo """"
              echo ""Reinstalling!""
              echo ""Deleting existing environment""
              rm -rf $env && echo ""Successfully deleted existing environment""
            elif [[ $ans = ""u"" ]]; then
              echo ""Updating!""

          echo """"
          echo ""Activating your dbt environment and installing the latest dbt version""

          if [[ $release == ""stable"" ]]; then
            source $env/bin/activate && pip install dbt -q -U && echo ""Successfully installed dbt:""
          elif [[ $release == ""pre"" ]]; then
            source $env/bin/activate && pip install dbt -q -U --pre && echo ""Successfully installed dbt:""
          else
            exit 1
          fi

          dbt --version
          deactivate

        }

        echo """"
        echo ""Initializing dbt environments""

        echo """"
        echo ""=== main dbt environment ===""

        process_environment $DBT_ENV stable

        echo """"
        echo ""=== dbt beta environment ===""

        process_environment $DBT_BETA_ENV pre

        echo """"
        echo ""If you would like to get the commands to set your aliases""
        echo -n ""to easily activate the environments respond with your shell or skip, [bash/zsh/skip]:""
        read ans_alias

        if [[ $ans_alias == ""bash"" ]]; then
          profile=~/.bash_profile
        elif [[ $release == ""zsh"" ]]; then
          profile=~/.zshrc
        else
          exit 1
        fi

        echo """"
        echo ""If you don't already have these aliases to quickly activate the dbt environments""
        echo ""run the following commands in your terminal then restart your terminal:""
        echo ""echo \""alias dbt-activate='source $DBT_ENV/bin/activate'\"" >> $profile""
        echo ""echo \""alias dbt-beta-activate='source $DBT_BETA_ENV/bin/activate'\"" >> $profile""
        ```

2. Paste the contents in a file in your `~/.dbt/` directory called: `dbt-update.sh`. This is the same folder where you'd find your `profiles.yml` file!
3. Run the following commands in your terminal:

    You can figure out your shell by checking the top of your iTerm2 window to see what's written, should be either `zsh` or `bash`

    - If you're using `zsh` (the new macOS default since macOS Catalina)

        ```bash
        chmod +x ~/.dbt/dbt-update.sh # this makes the file executable
        echo ""alias dbt-update='~/.dbt/dbt-update.sh'"" >> ~/.zshrc # this allows dbt-update to be run from anywhere
        ```

    - If you're using `bash` (disclaimer, I haven't tested this, let me know if you're trying it, would love to pair)

        ```bash
        chmod +x ~/.dbt/dbt-update.sh # this makes the file executable
        printf ""\nalias dbt-update='~/.dbt/dbt-update.sh'"" >> ~/.bash_profile # this allows dbt-update to be run from anywhere
        ```

4. Restart your terminal by closing the window and opening a new one (you could also run the `source` command against your config file)
5. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    dbt-update # yes it's that simple!
    ```

    You should see some printed status messages letting you know what's going on underneath. The script will now proceed to set up the `dbt` and `dbt-beta` environments for the first time, as well as install fresh dbt versions in each environment. At the end of each install, you should see the script print out the version of dbt that was installed. It should look something similar to this:
![Untitled|424x500](upload://hOiFUXP513u2y2kjTxwRwIzWPEy.png) 

6. Once your environment is set up, run the two commands that the script suggests you run in your terminal after it's been installed.
7. Restart your terminal one last time and you now should be able to run:

    ```bash
    dbt-activate
    ```

    and you will get something that looks like this:
![Untitled 1|472x478, 50%](upload://b4IClG1JdzORCqN6q0a5eYDg5ob.png) 

    After running the activate command, you should be able to see your terminal prefixed with the environment name (in this case `dbt`). You can do the same for the `dbt-beta` environment, just run:

    ```bash
    dbt-beta-activate
    ```

8. To deactivate your environments, just run:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

9. The next time you need to update dbt, just re run: `dbt-update`. It should detect that you already have the environments set up. It will then prompt you to choose whether you'd like to update or reinstall (type any other character to cancel out).

## Improving this workflow

I'm looking to see if anyone is familiar with how this could be deployed in a smoother way? Right now it requires that people have some familiarity with creating custom bash scripts and setting up aliases on their command line tool of choice. I would love to see some way to just distribute this across multiple machines with some simple install and maybe add some sort of flexibility so that users could potentially manage versions by just using some configurable options, instead of making edits to the raw [`dbt-update.sh`](http://dbt-update.sh) file. Feel free to reach out here and write some thoughts if this is interesting to you or if you've tackled the same problem differently in your organization!

2353,"setting-up-your-local-dbt-run-environments","I really like this approach @aescay, particularly that `venv` does not _require installing another package_. Thanks for sharing!

I've been working on establishing a consistent development environment for our Analytics Engineering team at Surfline as well. While `venv` is the simplest solution, we've settled on `conda` over `venv`, `pyenv-virtualenv`, `poetry`, and others for a few reasons:
1. Analytics Engineering falls under our Engineering team and they use `conda`.
2. Our Data Science team also uses `conda`. So all of our technical teams company wide use the same solution.
3. Other projects we work on at times require non-python packages (e.g., `gcc`) and `conda` really excels here.

It seems to me that knowing what the other technical teams in the org are using as a virtual environment manager is _likely_ the best indicator of what Analytics Engineering should use. 

In terms of ""improving this workflow"", I'd suggest checking out [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/). We use it so that anytime we navigate inside a repo with a `conda` environment, the `conda` env is automatically activated and when you navigate outside the repo it is automatically deactivated. This guards us against installs in the wrong environment (:scream:) and makes switching between projects super easy!

I imagine the same can be achieved with `venv` enviroments!",2
2353,"setting-up-your-local-dbt-run-environments","Got and fixed an error with this script, so I wanted to drop a note here!

2573,"triggering-a-dbt-cloud-job-in-your-automated-workflow-with-python","Say you want to create an automated workflow that includes a dbt Cloud Job. Maybe the workflow is within an orchestration tool like Airflow, Azure Data Factory, or AWS Step Functions. Or perhaps you want a dbt Cloud Job to be part of a git change management process powered by GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Azure DevOps. How can you do that?

Well, that's where the [dbt Cloud API](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api) comes in! The [`trigger job to run`](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api#operation/triggerRun) endpoint can be accessed to run a Job of your choosing. Then, you can use the [`get run`](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api#operation/getRunById) endpoint to implement a basic and effective API polling technique to check the Job Run status.

### Ideas for using this script

- Triggering a Continuous Integration job when you open a pull request in BitBucket or Azure DevOps. (Note: with GitHub and GitLab, [this can be done in dbt Cloud with the `Run On Pull Request` feature!](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-enabling-continuous-integration-with-github#enabling-continuous-integration-ci))
- Triggering a Production job when you merge a pull request in to the `main` branch.

2590,"running-dbt-in-composer-using-a-kubernetespodoperator","**Quick disclaimer**: *We use GCP and the solution is based on GCP only*

We've been using dbt for a while now and have had a few deployment choices. I'd like to explain how we went about getting the Airflow using a `KubernetesPodOperator` choice working and also give a brief explanation as to why. 

Let's start with the why. 
# Cloud Build Triggers and Cloud Scheduler
This was our first choice and we have a few models running using this strategy. This works well if you have no idea about Composer or Airflow. 
This works well if you have a set schedule to run your dbt models but can't trigger loads based non-dbt ingestion. This works well if you don't need any smarts in the scheduling process, such as checking that the previous load has completed before you start another load. This works well if you don't exceed the limitation of Cloud Scheduler. 
Plan B...
# Composer using a virtual environment 
Why run in a virtual environment and not install as a PyPI package? The dependencies of dbt PyPI package have conflicts with Composer's. Direct installation of dbt in Composer causes failure. And depending on the version of Composer the conflicts vary.
The choice bypassed all the issues that Cloud Scheduler had. We can trigger the dbt DAG via pub/sub message or schedule it. Current implementation is to create a temporary virtual environment with dbt installed for each dbt job. The virtual environment is destroyed when dbt job finished. 
Why stop using this option?  Running dbt job in virtual environment created in Composer is causing security threats. This Again the answer is simple, security. Google support is void installing software into an virtual environment bypassing security check.

And that is how we ended up with Plan C.
# Composer using a KubernetesPodOperator
Since the dbt models are docker containerised, dependency conflict issue will not be a problem.
As the KubernetesPodOperator will automatically spin up the pods to run the docker image, we do not need to manage the infrastructure.
This option will require monitoring on the Composer resource usage. And we need to scale it up or scale it out if it is needed. However, we have already been doing this as part of support.

## To-Do List:
1. Create a base Docker image Artifact of containing dbt, python, git and gcloud.
2. Create a Docker image Artifact of your dbt repo.
3. Set up Workload Identity.
4. Use the KubernetesPodOperator in your DAG.

## Build a base dbt Artifact
We decided to use a separate docker image that contains all the “installs” to execute a dbt command. This means that there is a central image for updating versions and also compilation time for docker image using this dbt docker image is much faster.

To enable this, we created a base_dbt_docker repo with the following files:
1. A docker file
2. A requirements.txt file
3. A yaml file to create a docker image of your repo in the Artifact repository

## Docker file
*Feel free to try alpine instead of ubuntu. I had issues with getting gcloud and python installed in alpine.*
```make
FROM ubuntu:20.04
COPY . /app/

RUN apt-get update 
# Install gcloud
RUN echo ""deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg]   cloud-sdk main"" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list

# Install Python
RUN apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y python3.8 python3-pip 
# Install dbt
RUN python3 -m pip install -r /app/requirements.txt

## Requirements file

This is a simple file containing the version of dbt to install `dbt>=0.18.1`

## YAML file

The naming format for an Artifact is LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID/REPOSITORY/IMAGE. For more information, have a look at this [link](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling#tag). Our location is australia-southeast1, please adjust accordingly.

![image|457x500](upload://lYmQYWyuYFheNw9lVICs6eH5Jii.png)

**Remember** that each time there is a change in the repo, you need to rebuild the Artifact, just run the Cloud Build trigger again. You'll need to rebuild the dbt project Artifact too.

# Build a dbt project Artifact
You will need the following files in your repo:
1. A docker file
2. A shell script that will execute your dbt commands
3. A yaml file to create a docker image of your repo in the Artifact repository


## Docker file
Note that the docker file points to the base dbt Artifact you had just created, see the FROM.
```
ARG project_id
ARG base_artifact
ARG base_image

FROM australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/${project_id}/${base_artifact}/${base_image}
COPY . /app/
RUN echo ""dbt via docker""

RUN chmod +x /app/dbt_run.sh
WORKDIR /app/
ENTRYPOINT [""/app/dbt_run.sh"" ]`
```
## Shell script
The .sh file executes the dbt commands and currently caters for dbt run and dbt debug.
```sh
#!/bin/bash
mode=$1
dbt_target=$2
dbt_models=$3
dbt_vars=$4
full_refresh=$5

cd /app/

if [ $mode = ""run"" ]; then
    echo ""dbt Mode is run""
    if [ $full_refresh = ""True"" ]; then
        echo ""Doing a full refresh""
        dbt run --target=""$dbt_target"" --models=""$dbt_models"" --vars=""$dbt_vars"" --profiles-dir=/app/profiles_dir --full-refresh
    else
        echo ""Not doing a full refresh""
        dbt run --target=""$dbt_target"" --models=""$dbt_models"" --vars=""$dbt_vars"" --profiles-dir=/app/profiles_dir
    fi
elif [ $mode = ""debug"" ]; then
    echo ""dbt Mode is debug""
    dbt debug --profiles-dir=/app/profiles_dir --target=""$dbt_target""
else   
    echo ""Incorrect dbt Mode. Nothing to do""
fi

# capture the exit code from the dbt run command
# so that the final exit code form removing virtualenv cmd doesn't get used by KubernetesPodOperator 
exit_code=$?

# rethrowing the exit code to KubernetesPodOperator
exit $exit_code 
```
Note the correlation between the `COPY . /app/` from the docker file and the `cd /app/` in the .sh file

### YAML file
```yaml
steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  entrypoint: 'bash'
  args: ['-c', 'docker build --build-arg ""_PROJECT_ID=${_PROJECT_ID}"" --build-arg ""base_artifact=${_BASE_ARTIFACT}"" --build-arg ""base_image=${_BASE_IMAGE}"" -t ${_REPO_NAME} .']

- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  entrypoint: 'bash'
  args: ['-c', 'docker tag ${_REPO_NAME} australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/${_PROJECT_ID}/${_REPO_NAME}/${_IMAGE_NAME}']
  
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  entrypoint: 'bash'
  args: ['-c', 'docker push australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/${_PROJECT_ID}/${_REPO_NAME}/${_IMAGE_NAME}']

  substitutions:
    _PROJECT_ID: $PROJECT_ID
```
Create a Cloud Build trigger to use this yaml to build the Artifact.

![image|403x500](upload://nVzWVthPYRBYeoVgSWkzaOQvdUD.png)

**Remember** that each time there is a change in the repo, you need to rebuild the Artifact, just run the Cloud Build trigger again. 

## Workload Identity
What is Workload Identity? It is basically a way to make a Kubernetes service account have the same credentials as a Google service account. Or as Google puts it, “*Workload Identity is the recommended way to access Google Cloud services from applications running within GKE due to its improved security properties and manageability.*”
Here is the [link](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) to Google’s documentation. It gives an in-depth explanation of Workload Identity and has an easy-to-follow set of steps to get Workload Identity up and running. Below are the steps we took, a condensed version.

Steps (these steps can be done with Terraform too):
1. [Update a cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity#enable_on_cluster) with Workload Identity enabled. (Another option is creating a new cluster)
`gcloud container clusters update <cluster_name> --zone australia-southeast1-a --project=<project_id> --workload-pool=<gcp_project_id>.svc.id.goog`
2. [Add a new node pool](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity#option_1_node_pool_creation_with_recommended) to the cluster with Workload Identity enabled. (Another option is to modify an existing node pool but that it not recommended)
`gcloud container node-pools create <node_pool_name> --zone australia-southeast1-a --project=<project_id> --cluster=<cluster_name> --workload-metadata=GKE_METADATA --machine-type=<pick_a_type default is e2-medium>`
3. [Authenticating to Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity#authenticating_to)
-- Configure kubectl to communicate with the cluster
`gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster_name> --zone australia-southeast1-a --project=<project_id>`
-- Create the namespace to use for the Kubernetes service account
`kubectl create namespace <k8s_namespace>`
-- Create the Kubernetes service account
`kubectl create serviceaccount --namespace <k8s_namespace> <k8s_sa>`
-- Allow the Kubernetes service account to impersonate the Google service account by creating an IAM policy binding between the two
`gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser --member ""serviceAccount:<gcp_project_id>.svc.id.goog[<k8s_namespace>/<k8s_sa>]"" <gcp_sa> --project=<project_id>`  
-- Add the iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account annotation to the Kubernetes service account
`kubectl annotate serviceaccount --namespace <k8s_namespace> <k8s_sa> iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=<gcp_sa>`

# KubernetesPodOperator
 Here is the [link](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to/using/using-kubernetes-pod-operator) to Google’s documentation. 
We use the same mechanism that trigger and schedule the Virtual environment DAG. I'm not explaining that mechanism but just as a final step I'm giving you the minimum requirements for your `KubernetesPodOperator` DAG.
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow import models
# Make sure to add below
from airflow.contrib.operators.kubernetes_pod_operator import KubernetesPodOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

args = {
    'owner': 'dummy',
    'retries': 0,
}

docker_dag = DAG(
    dag_id='dbt_docker_test',
    default_args=args,
    schedule_interval=None,
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    catchup=False,
    tags=['dbt run model'],
)

quay_k8s = KubernetesPodOperator(
    # k8s namespace created earlier
    namespace='kube-pod', 
    # k8s service account name created earlier
    service_account_name='ap-kube-pod-sa', 
    # Ensures that the right node-pool is used
    nodeSelector={'http://cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool ': 'k8sworkload-pool'}, 
    # Ensures that cache is always refreshed
    image_pull_policy='Always', 
    # Artifact image of dbt repo
    image='australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/<gcp-project-id>/<artifact>/<artifact-image>', 
    # links to ENTRYPOINT in .sh file
    cmds=['/app/dbt_run.sh'], 
    # matches sequence of arguments in .sh file (mode,dbt_target,dbt_models,dbt_vars,full_refresh)
    arguments=['run', 'projectzone', 'tag:test2', '{from_date: """", to_date: """"}','False'], 
    name=""run-dbt-in-pod"",
    task_id=""run-dbt-in-pod"",
    get_logs=True,
    dag=docker_dag,    
    )
```
The key to making sure that the DAG use the k8s service account is the `service_account_name` argument. The documentation suggests using kubernetes secrets but that doesn’t work for our purposes.
We also found that the Artifact image isn’t always updated and that a cached version is used. Using argument `image_pull_policy='Always'` solves this issue.

And there you have it. Follow these steps, put the DAG in the correct folder in Composer and you'll have dbt running using a KubernetesPodOperator.

Questions?
Feel free to ask and I'll respond as best I can.

2603,"how-we-sped-up-our-ci-runs-by-10x-using-slim-ci","_Edit, October 2021: I wrote this before joining the dbt Labs team, while I was the Head of Data at Education Perfect. Please interpret_ ""we"" _accordingly!_

The core of dbt’s value proposition is that analytics code is an asset, like any other piece of code, so it should be developed and deployed with the same rigorous processes as any other piece of code. A key principle behind this rigour is Continuous Integration--as you modify code, automatically check that your intended changes don’t break the rest of the project. Sounds great, right?

Well, during a [recent dbt Staging event](https://youtu.be/2i1rVK50K64?t=1991), we heard that only about a third of dbt Cloud customers have CI runs configured. This means that everyone else is either finding their bugs in production, or they are manually running tests that a robot could handle for them! ^[They could also be writing perfect code first time.] Neither of these are great options.

I want to share our CI history as we expanded from a tiny project in early 2020 to several hundred models and 1000+ automated tests today. As our project has scaled up, we’ve taken advantage of more advanced features in dbt Core and Cloud to keep a tight feedback loop and help our team be more confident in their work.

*NB: we use dbt Cloud at Education Perfect, so this article focuses on that use case. Everything I describe here can also be done via dbt Core - the Cloud product just makes some of the setup easier (especially artifact management).*

## The start of our dbt journey
Early on, we only had a few models, so doing a full run of everything was pretty quick.
![we'll-take-the-lot|400x180](upload://d7MSHNCYbF6ucTFoCxsBFlJRjfa.gif)

If we made a mistake, it didn’t take long to find out, AND it didn’t hurt anyone! This was a much happier place to be than our pre-dbt paradigm of pushing to live, then frantically refreshing the changed report so that if we’d forgotten a comma we could revert it before anyone noticed. 
![first-ci-job-slack|597x447, 75%](upload://9BVjBUxJR9ND6Zz6Y6VmTC6rRjL.png)

## Saving time with target-aware configuration
As our project matured, we started to build complex models which didn’t perform well as views. Every time someone hit refresh in Mode, Redshift ran the whole query from scratch, which meant our users had to wait several minutes for results. We changed to materializing these large models as tables, but that made our CI jobs take much longer. Another easy fix: dbt lets you provide a different materialization config for CI or dev environments vs prod.

We added a `config` block to the top of relevant files (you can also do this in your `dbt_project.yml` file ^[Spoilers!]) like this:
![config-unrendered|537x100](upload://nrsubkQLfTdWjBUQbAYv1udYcyc.png)
which turns into either 
![config-rendered-table|218x114](upload://fWeVxMYzSxnZQUR7riYvdEqvjoP.png) or ![config-rendered-view|210x111](upload://nEYHNjLjK9A2djVoLDVR7DcDDhl.png).
It was a huge win to avoid wasting time generating redundant tables over and over again.

Despite these optimisations, by the six month mark our CI jobs tipped over 50 minutes--an inevitability given the project’s size and complexity but much too slow for an effective feedback loop. 

## Sidebar: How tight is tight enough?

“Tight feedback loop” is one of those sneaky phrases that gets people to nod along without thinking about the specifics. Having experienced run times between 3 minutes and 2 hours over the last year, I think that *if you can’t see the results of your changes within a 5-10 minute window, it’s too slow to be effective.*

Ironically though, this goal can discourage testing! I noticed that when I should have been adding tests, I was so concerned about our ballooning runtime that I tried to convince myself that new ones weren’t necessary. This is a false economy! Testing our assumptions is critical. We must be notified when our assumptions no longer hold. It saves hours of debugging and ensures that we always have the opportunity to correctly read our data.

So, if we want to maintain solid test coverage, but also want to get results in less than 10 minutes, we have to find another solution.

An obvious question is: “if we’re only changing a web sessions model, why are we bothering to re-test the other 99% of the project?” Most models aren’t directly related to one another. Wouldn’t it be great if we could just tell dbt to ignore the other models and focus on what has changed?

## We discover Slim CI
Enter [Slim CI](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/legacy/best-practices#run-only-modified-models-to-test-changes-slim-ci)! dbt can now detect the things that actually need to be tested by comparing each model’s code to the version that was used in the last successful run, and only testing those that have changed in this PR. When we implemented this by [picking the job to compare to in the Cloud UI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-enabling-continuous-integration-with-github#defer-to-a-production-job) and adding `state:modified` to our `--models` selector, we immediately saw a 2.5x increase in performance - CI jobs that once took 50 minutes were complete in 20.
![dbt-cloud-deferral-dropdown|690x134, 75%](upload://mVcogPeVDMCjf47iTbTO0zscn0w.png)

## Didn't you say 10x in the title?
There was one significant downside remaining: dynamic materialization config, our saviour introduced above, was now our most significant source of wasted effort. This was a problem because dbt only compares the CI version of the model file to the production version *after* rendering Jinja. Ironically, our slowest models were the only ones that were still built and tested on every run, because their CI materialization config was different to production.

Fortunately, there’s an improvement in dbt 0.19.0: if you set your config in your `dbt_project.yml` file instead of inline the *unrendered* config is stored for comparison. When that launched, we moved our configurations and got down to 5 minute runs - a 10x improvement compared to where we were before Slim CI. Historically, [best practice](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/model-configs#configuring-models) has been to put folder-wide settings in the project file, and deviations from the norm inline with the model. In this case, the performance gains are so substantial that I’d recommend adding all dynamic configuration in `dbt_project.yml`.

## Where to from here?

We’ve started to spend our savings on a more robust pipeline which tests modified models *and* their descendants, after being bitten a couple of times by a model which passed on its own but broke something downstream.

We initially did this in the most naive way (`dbt test -m state:modified+`) but found that to be overkill. Instead, we’re validating the first-level children as well as anything that powers an exposure (`dbt test -m state:modified+1 1+exposure:*,state:modified+`). This gives a good balance between catching the most likely failure points while not wasting too much time.
*Not sure what all the pluses and stars and commas mean? Check out the docs on [graph](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/graph-operators) and [set](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/set-operators) operators, or the appendix below.*

The parsing improvements in [0.19.1](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/faster-dbt-startup-in-v0-19-1-beta/2142) are another bonus - by increasing parsing performance by 2-3x, there’s less fixed cost to commands like `dbt seed` which parse the whole project even if there’s nothing to do (as is often the case with seeds). 

With a combination of Slim CI, moving our materialization configs outside of the model file, and the big speed boosts in the latest versions of dbt, it’s not uncommon for us to now see runs completing in 3-4 minutes, while still maintaining full confidence that we’ll know if something unexpected happens. If you’re not already using CI, start there! But once you’re ready to step it up, it’s very achievable to get even bigger wins in minimal time. 

Huge thanks to @Mila for reading early drafts of this post, and @jerco for finding a bug in my job selectors 😬


## Appendix: Our full CI job definitions
⚠️ *dbt Cloud automatically adds the `--defer` and `--state` flags. If you're using something else to orchestrate CI, you'll need to include them yourself.*
### seed
**`dbt --warn-error seed --select state:modified sales__currencies --full-refresh`**

We include `--warn-error` in our `seed` step to ensure that any project-level warnings are resolved prior to merge. For example, we might move models whose configuration is defined in `dbt_project.yml` into a different folder. This would normally only be raised as a warning ^['Configuration paths exist in your dbt_project.yml file which do not apply to any resources', to be precise.], but now we'll be forced to fix it! 

Amusingly, there's also a warning if your selector returns no results ^['Nothing to do. Try checking your model configs and model specification args', to be precise.], so we have to explicitly rebuild a single tiny seed (`sales__currencies`) every time.

Finally, we `--full-refresh` every time to ensure that any table changes (new columns, changed types) are applied.

### run
**`dbt run -m state:modified+1 1+exposure:*,state:modified+`**

`state:modified+1` refers to the modified model and its [first-order children](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/graph-operators#the-n-plus-operator). `1+exposure:*,state:modified+` uses the [intersection operator](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/set-operators#intersections) to get any models which are referenced in an [exposure](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/exposures) and depend on a modified model.

### test
**`dbt test -m state:modified+1 1+exposure:*,state:modified+ --exclude test_name:relationships test_name:relationships_where tag:fragile`**

The `-m` selector is the same as the `run` job above. We exclude all relationship tests ^[Looking forward to getting rid of `relationships_where` in dbt 0.20.0!] to avoid [oddities from the deferral process](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/defer#test) or pipelines being out of sync, as well as a handful of explicitly-tagged fragile tests who cause more trouble than they're worth in this context.",1

I'm well aware of the concept that you create an exposures file in your models' folder, then you declare the table name and the other tables/sources that it depends on.

Q1 - Should I state the whole downstream of tables or just the direct tables that it depends on?

Q2 - What exact benefit does it do? Can you come up with a specific scenario?

Q3 - what the purpose of dbt run -m exposure:name and dbt test -m exposure:name? Is it testing the model or the exposure?

Q1 - Should I state the whole downstream of tables or just the direct tables that it depends on?
[/quote]
You only need to state the final model(s) in your exposure - it will automatically detect all parents from there to display in the DAG.

[quote=""MadsS, post:1, topic:2626""]
Q2 - What exact benefit does it do? Can you come up with a specific scenario?
[/quote]
A couple of use cases:

1. If you're using dbt Cloud, you can generate a metadata tile which shows data freshness and test success in your BI tool. Check out [this video from earlier in the year](https://youtu.be/5QvdNYPQofE?t=46m22s) for a demo 
2. We used exposures recently to know which reports would be impacted by a series of source tables being deprecated. We could identify all of them at once and make decisions about whether to upgrade them or replace them. Without exposures, we would have done our best to find them but probably missed one which would have impacted our business users. 
3. It can add confidence in your CI runs to know that proposed changed won't impact dashboards etc

Q3 - what the purpose of dbt run -m exposure:name and dbt test -m exposure:name? Is it testing the model or the exposure?
[/quote]
On their own, running and testing an exposure won't do anything. However, when you use the [+ operator](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/graph-operators#the-plus-operator), it will run/test the models that feed into an exposure.

You're right - dbt truncates and re-inserts into the table during a `dbt seed` step. You can use the `--full-refresh` flag to force it to drop your seed table, which saves you from having to manually drop it: https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/full_refresh#seeds",5

2782,"advanced-schema-tests-thresholds-exclusions-and-date-limits","At Rezdy we’ve got our fair share of failing dbt tests and it goes without saying that when you have a failing test you should always address the root cause of the problem. 

That being said it’s a lot faster just to sweep non-critical failing tests under the rug and get on with your day. These ""advanced"" schema tests are like the trap door under the rug.

Inspired by a [post on creating error thresholds for schema tests](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/creating-an-error-threshold-for-schema-tests/966), we set out to create a malleable dbt schema test for our most troublesome tests(unique and not_null)

The test handles 3 cases:

1. Date scoping the dataset before running the test
2. Implementing either a absolute or relative error threshold for row failure
3. Explicitly exclude dodgy rows from tests

Date scoping has been covered a fair bit already and is [likely to be made redundant by either dbt_utils or the new capability of the not_null schema test in dbt v0.20.0](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/migrating-away-from-dbt-utils-not-null-where-and-unique-where-tests/2773) and thresholds have received a fair bit of attention so this post is mostly about the more idiosyncratic test exclusions option. 

The test exclusion functionality allows us to test a dataset as normal but put in a small clause such as:

*Even though all customers who sign up should have a trial event before they have a purchase event(`trial_id` not null in `fct_purchase`), there was that one time back in 2018 where a customer managed to somehow do it because of a bug. We'll make a note of the customers ID and the reason why they don't have a trial in our exclusion file (a seed file or a google sheet if you can swing it **Hail BigQuery**) then move on with our lives.*


*Note:*

* There are separate test macros for not_null and unique but they are identical except for the logic that captures duplicates or nulls in the `perform_test` CTE.
* These models are currently running on a BigQuery warehouse, you might need to tweak some syntax to get it to run on other warehouses.* 
* The two supporting macros; `get_model_ref `and `exclude_rows_from_test` are also included down the bottom.
* You can name the macros test_not_null and test_unique without the adv prefix and they will just replace the ones that come with dbt, but then you have to go and update your whole project.
* `tbl_test_exclusions` is the name of the table where we store both the rows that will be excluded and the reason for doing so you can call this whatever you like.
* If you've been doing some black magic with condition blocks and ref statements and encountered the below test ERROR, it might be worth checking out the `get_model_ref` macro down the bottom.

```
Compilation Error in test some_test_name (models/staging/something/something.yml)
  dbt was unable to infer all dependencies for the model ""some_test_name"".
  This typically happens when ref() is placed within a conditional block.

  To fix this, add the following hint to the top of the model ""some_test_name"":
```




**Not Null**

```

/* -----------------------------------------------------

This is an advanced not_null schema test.
It is used the same way the normal not_null schema test is used inside the .yml file
however instead of:

The test has 3 functions:
 - Thresholds (absolute and relative)
 - Date Limits (by day)
 - Row Exclusions (nit picking out bad rows)

Usage Notes:
  Thresholds are calculated after date scoping.
  When testing relative thresholds use values 1 to 100 indicating the % of bad rows expected.
  The error output for threshold fields indicates the number of fails beyond the threshold.
    not the absolute number of fails. (The absolute number can be obtained from a normal test.)
  A single test can use all 3 functions.

**The Test Exclusion Macro**

```
/* -----------------------------------------------------
This is the macro that allows the advanced schema tests to access the tbl_test_exclusions 
table.

Arguments:
- model_name: The model you wish to exclude from
- column_name: The column name you wish to exclude on

Output:
A SQL clause that will exclude rows from a table.

Usage:
  Example use case:
  In 2019 a bug allowed a single customer (dim_customer.customer_id =123)
  to be able to sign up without a last name. Then the not_null schema test on
  dim_customer.last_name would always fail on a single row. How Annoying!

  Usage of this macro depends on the configuration of the tbl_test_exclusions
  table schema. It should have the following columns:
    id:               surrogate key for the exclusion table.[N]
    exclusion_value:  unique key of the model that you wish to exclude a row from for testing.[123]
    model_name:       The name of the model that you wish to exclude a row from. [dim_customer]
    column_name:      The name of the column you wish to exclude on. [customer_id]
    owner:            String field to indicate who decided to exclude the row from testing.[your_name]
    description:      String field to explain why this row is special. [Bug back in 2019 that allowed a single customer to sign up with no last name.]

Notes:
The exclusion table can be any table in the database. dbt seed files and Gsheets
work well.
The macro should be placed inside a SQL WHERE clause, either:
- after WHERE
- or after AND
Because of the way get_mode_ref() works, if you choose to create a base table for your
tbl_test_exclusions model you will need to set the schema=none

Scope: Identifying data for rows in models that we wish to exclude from certain tests because

Config:
This model has to be a table because the source data is a a gsheet which has strange errors
when it is repeatedly queried.

The schema must be set to none because it is referred to using the get_model_ref macro
which is designed to get around a strange issue with using refs in conditional blocks.

Here's how you do it :arrow_down:

**Step 1: Set up your Terminal to use Rosetta.**
Go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal (or go to whatever other Terminal app you use), right click, select ‘Get Info’ and then select ‘Open using Rosetta’ under the General options. Close the Get Info window.

**Step 2: Open your Terminal and uninstall any versions of dbt you may have tried to install before.**
I’m team Homebrew  - run `brew uninstall dbt` in the Terminal*. Then, if you run `which dbt` you should get `dbt not found`.

*Per @claire - you may also consider uninstalling Homebrew completely and reinstalling brew via Rosetta first.

**Step 3: Create a python virtual environment and install dbt.**
Full instructions [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/), but run these are the exact commands I ran in the Terminal:

`python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip`
`python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv`
`python3 -m venv env`
`source env/bin/activate`
`pip3 install dbt==0.19.0`
`pip3 install --upgrade pip`
`dbt --version`

**Step 4: Change your working directory, if necessary.**

**Step 5: Do whatever you need to do in dbt!**

**Step 6: Deactivate your virtual environment.**
Run `deactivate` in the Terminal.

And that's it! Hope this saves some time for anyone struggling through the same situation :blush:",1

First of all, if dbt is the *only* command line program you are having issues with, use Olya's approach! It's great!

I personally was finding that I had M1 issues on other programs installed via homebrew (pyenv, ruby, everything, gah!) that a python env wouldn't solve, so I had to do something a little more drastic!

Here's what I did:
1. Completely uninstalled homebrew, and all brew-installed programs
I can't remember the exact instructions here, but think this was pretty google-able

2. Relauched iTerm with Rosetta.
This is a way to use programs as though they are operating on an non-M1 Mac
To do this: right-click on iTerm, click 'Get Info', and check the 'Open using Rosetta' option.

3. Reinstalled homebrew using my (Rosetta) iTerm
This let me install dbt without issues, and all my other programs :tada:

Granted, using this approach unilaterally means that I lose some of the speedups from the M1 chip, and some programs *are* compatible with the M1 chip.

If you want to take advantage of the M1 software where possible, some solutions on the internet also suggest that it's possible to run a dual setup, so that you can install M1-compatible software on the M1 architecture, and then have a backup way to install non-compatible software (like dbt).

There are two main approaches to a dual setup, neither of which I could get to work, but you may be able to! I've included a conceptual overview of both for context

**Option 1: Using two versions of iTerm (one using the M1 architecture, one using Rosetta):**
To create your second iTerm app, copy your iTerm app, name it ""iTerm rosetta"" version, and launch it using Rosetta.
Then install homebrew from the iTerm Rosetta app, and any incompatible programs.
Default to using your standard iTerm app when installing programs, and use the iTerm Rosetta app when installing programs that have compatibility issues.
I copied the app successfully, but couldn't get the two versions of homebrew to coexist.

**Option 2: Using one iTerm application, but two versions of homebrew**
To install the second version of brew (using Rosetta) use `arch -x86_64` as a prefix to the installation command ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64882584/how-to-run-the-homebrew-installer-under-rosetta-2-on-m1-macbook)).
Then use that prefix again when installing programs with the old version of homebrew: `arch -x86_64 brew install <package>`.
Default to using the standard brew command when installing programs, and use the prefixed brew command when installing programs that have compatibility issues.
Again, I couldn't get this to play nicely, mostly due to `pyenv` issues.

The issues I hit were to do with `$PATH` variables, sourcing commands (esp. on `pyenv`, a tool I use a lot) and all kinds of things that I hate debugging. A more patient person than me could probably get a dual architecture working! For now, I'm sticking with my Rosetta-only approach.",2
2908,"get-dbt-up-and-running-from-the-command-line-on-a-macbook-with-an-m1-chip","Hey folks! Adding in my solution which worked for dbt 0.20.1, Python 3.9.6 and M1 Mac.

This will require using Pycharm as the IDE for building and running dbt models.


**Step 1** : Use Pycharm IDE ( latest version) for development & terminal emulator within the IDE for running dbt commands

**Step 2**:  Create virtualenv with Python 3.9.* installed in it.


**Step 3** . Add the location of above as the interpreter in PyCharm



**Step 4**. Install dbt inside the interpreter through PyCharm.  Latest version of Pycharm has started supporting M1 ARM architecture without any explicit configurations, see the blog post [here](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2021/01/the-transition-to-apple-silicon/).

![Screen Shot 2021-08-31 at 1.32.28 PM|578x500](upload://iX0twHeo00ul9UbLUmV5l8nF0wM.png)


**Step 5** . *dbt run* inside the terminal emulator might throw the error ""command not found"". Solution to this is to alias '*dbt*' in bashrc/zshrc to point to dbt installation location.

`alias dbt=/Users/aathresh/.pyenv/versions/dbt-env/bin/dbt`",3
2908,"get-dbt-up-and-running-from-the-command-line-on-a-macbook-with-an-m1-chip","Chiming in with my experience dealing with this...

I ended up with the same solution as you, Claire. I tried the ""both"" thing (using your option 1, two versions of iTerm). Some of my projects were in the M1 setup and I switched them over to Rosetta as-needed if I ran into M1 compatibility issues. I was able to mostly get it to work although there were a lot of hiccups, especially around my .zshrc/.bashrc files. 

After a few weeks I decided it was just too annoying/confusing/complex. I do everything w a Rosetta terminal now and basically just pretend I'm not on an M1. I have the base Macbook Air model and everything feels pretty snappy despite being in the emulator.",4
2908,"get-dbt-up-and-running-from-the-command-line-on-a-macbook-with-an-m1-chip","Just a quick note on the original code in the article that tripped me up. dbt requires psycopg2 (or in the M1 case, psycopg2-binary) dependency. When following these steps, a critical error is to not upgrade pip AFTER you activate your virtual environment.

I spent a solid amount of time trying to figure out why nothing would load, thinking the pip upgrade outside of the virtual environment would propogate through - that is not the case.


```
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install psycopg2-binary 
pip3 install dbt
```

Then you're good to go",5

2909,"the-exact-privileges-we-grant-to-set-up-redshift","> :sparkles: **2021 update** :sparkles:
This article originally appeared as part of an article that covered grant statements for both Redshift and Snowflake (Snowflake version [here](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/the-privileges-we-grant-to-set-up-snowflake/439)). The original was written in 2019, when I was an employee of dbt Labs. Now, I’m freelancing (among other things), and actually got the opportunity to set up some new Snowflake databases recently. I took the opportunity to update some of my advice over on the Snowflake version of this article, and figured it was more logical to have two separate articles. Note that I haven't used Redshift lately, but I think this advice still stands (until they implement cross-database queries for everyone, not just those using `ra3` nodes).

Before reading through these exact instructions, take a moment to read some prior art:

1. @jerco’s [article](https://blog.getdbt.com/how-we-configure-snowflake/) on setting up the concepts behind sending up Snowflake for clients — we're trying to apply a lot of the same ideas on Redshift, but with less flexibility (namely, no databases or warehouses)
2. My article on [database administration](https://blog.getdbt.com/five-principles-that-will-keep-your-data-warehouse-organized/)

While these article go deep into the “what” and “why” of database admin respectively, it was pretty light on the very specific “how” of setting this up, i.e. the implementation steps.

In this guide, I’ll run through the exact privileges it takes to set up your Redshift cluster the way these articles intended.

# 1. Set up the database
On Redshift, you can't run cross-database queries, so we'll do everything in one single database. By default, Redshift creates a database named `dev`, so let's create our own one with a better name
```sql
create database analytics
```

# 2. Set up groups
We'll grant privileges to these groups rather than to users directly
```sql
create group loader;
create group transformer;
create group reporter;
```

# 3. Create users, assigning them to their groups
Every human being and application gets a separate user, and is assigned to the correct shared role.
```
create user stitch -- or fivetran
    password '_generate_this_'
    in group loader;

create user claire -- or amy, jeremy, etc
    password '_generate_this_'
    in group transformer; 

create user dbt_cloud
    password '_generate_this_'
    in group transformer;

create user looker -- or mode or periscope
    password '_generate_this_'
    in group reporter;
```


# 4. Let `loader` load data
By granting a user the privilege to create a schema within a database, they will also then be able to create tables and views within that schema. 

```
grant create on database analytics to group loader;
grant select on all tables in schema information_schema to group loader;
grant select on all tables in schema pg_catalog to group loader;
grant select on all tables in schema information_schema to group transformer;
grant select on all tables in schema pg_catalog to group transformer;
```
^ I've also snuck in some statements to give privileges to information schemas here – these are required by both your ETL tools (i.e. members of your `loader` group) and by dbt users (i.e. members of your `transformer` group).

# 5. Wait...
If you've just set up your database from scratch, you'll have to wait a while here for data to start flowing before you can grant privileges for members of your `transformer` group to read it.

# 6. Let `transformer` transform data
Once your raw data is in your warehouse, you'll need to give privileges for your `transformer` group to read it!

There are three parts to granting the privilege to read all relations within a schema:
* Granting usage on a schema
* Granting select privileges on all existing relations within a schema
* Granting select privileges on all relations created in this schema in the future (default privileges), so that you don't need to rerun grant statements for every new object in the schema.

On Redshift, this looks like:
```
-- for each schema:
grant usage on schema raw_stripe to group transformer;
grant select on all tables in schema raw_stripe to group transformer;
-- note that the `for user` clause should be adjusted based on the user who will be creating
-- objects in the schema (which should also be the schema owner).
alter default privileges for user stitch in schema raw_stripe
  grant select on tables to group transformer;
```
You'll need to rerun these whenever you add a new schema to your database via Fivetran or Stitch

This group also needs to be able to create in the database:
```sql
grant create on database analytics to group transformer;
```
And needs some permissions to generate dbt docs
```sql
grant select on all tables in schema information_schema to group transformer;
grant select on all tables in schema pg_catalog to group transformer;
```

# 7. Let `reporter` read the transformed data

The `reporter` role should be able to read anything that dbt creates.

In Redshift, we implement these via an [on-run-end hook](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-hooks) – check out [this](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/the-exact-grant-statements-we-use-in-a-dbt-project/430) article about the exact hooks we run!

# 8. Maintain!
When new users are added, make sure you add them to the right shared role! And as new schemas of raw data are added, ensure that privileges are granted to the `transformer` role to be able to read them.",1

## Intro

When our team first started using the dbt CLI, we started with Claire's well-loved discourse post, [How we set up our computers for working on dbt project](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-set-up-our-computers-for-working-on-dbt-projects/243). The post details how the dbt team uses Atom and iTerm 2 on macOS for an improved workflow. Many folks commented on how they acheived similar productivity using VSCode. I thought I'd consolidate some of this into a single article, and expand on it given the recent developments. I'm also going to add things to make it easier for working with Azure databases such as the Azure CLI and Azure Data Studio.

### Goals

Following this guide will enable the following behavior in VSCode (some points lifted from Claire's guide -- linked above)

- a stable, reproducible Python environment for running dbt
- syntax highlighting for SQL files with jinja in them
- graying out the text of files that have compiled code in them, to help prevent you from editing compiled SQL (as opposed to your actual model)
- quick switching b/w a model file and it's `compiled` and `run` counterparts 
- allow  


### Prerequisite

If you've never used VSCode with Python, I strongly recommend at least the first half of  Dan Taylor's [Get Productive with Python in Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnOPp4DsY2w) talks. It covers a lot of the basics like installing Python, the Python extension, and the command pallette.

You should also have the following installed:

- Git
- VSCode
- Python 3 (via anaconda, brew or [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) )

In VSCode you'll also need to install the Python extension

### If you already know VSCode

Here's [a gist for an example .vscode directory](https://gist.github.com/swanderz/5cf876d88c7c8d268d8c1e1e5d05bffd) that contains a `settings.json` and an `extensions.json`

### Getting started

To get started, we'll use the [jaffle_shop repo](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop), a self-contained project.

You can use the Git CLI or the VSCode Git extension to Git Clone command in VSCode
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop.git
```

Then, open the `jaffle_shop/` directory in VSCode.

## Python environment


### Goal

The goal of this section is to ensure that the right version of Python and dbt are always available right away when you open your dbt project in VSCode. Sounds simple, but below is a one-time setup guide on how to make it work. More context is that some folks have bundled this set up process into [bash scripts](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/setting-up-your-local-dbt-run-environments/2353) and [Docker containers](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/a-containerized-dbt-environment-for-your-team/2340).

Some folks deem this problem so difficult as to justify having users use Docker containers, but I have yet to be convinced of that yet.

### Walkthrough

Python can be tricky get working in VSCode (and trickier to work on Windows). You OS likely already has a version of python installed, but this can be troublesome because you don't control it's version.

It's better practice to have a dedicated dbt environment. Three popular tools are `venv`'s, `virtualenv`'s and `conda` environments. Our team uses `conda` envs because we have many different projects with different sets of package requirements, but if dbt is 1) your only use case for Python, or 2) your first Python-based use case, you'll likely have a better time with `virtualenvs`. I'm going to only talk about venv because it comes built-in with Python

Open a terminal with `CTRL+`` (which should open within the jaffle_shop directory) and do the following steps:

```bash
# make sure you have Python at least 3.6 and less than 3.10
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .dbtenv
source .dbtenv/bin/activate

# install the dbt package you want
pip install dbt-synapse # or dbt-sqlserver or whatever

# make Git ignore all these newly created files
echo '.dbtenv/' > .gitignore
```

Once you've done this you should now be able to:
1. bring up the command pallette (`CMD+SHIFT+P`)
2. search for ""Python: Select Interpreter"", and
3. Pick the `.dbtenv` environment (should be the first result)

Those three steps will:

1. activate the Python extension if it hasn't been already
2. ensure that all new terminals opened in VSCode will auto-activate your `.dbtenv` environment

This is huge because now all your terminals in the VSCode will always have your dbt package available. However, this behavior will not persist the next time you open this repo in VSCode. To make this auto-env selection persist, you must do two things:
1. add a `requirements.txt` to you the top level of the repo ([pip docs on `requirements.txt` files](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files))
2. (optional) add to the `requirements.txt` what packages w/ versions you plan to do in this project (example below)
3. create a new file `.vscode/settings.json` and add the Python path to the `settings.json` (more on VSCode settings later!)

#### `requirements.txt`
```
dbt-synapse==0.19.2
sqlfluff==0.7.1
```
#### `.vscode/settings.json`
```json
{
    // change this to your desired path!
    ""python.pythonPath"": ""./.dbtenv/bin/python"",
}
```

Now that you've done these two things, everytime you open the `jaffle_shop/` dir, in VSCode two things should happen:
1. the Python extension activates right away (do you see the Python version listed alongside your environment name on the bottom info bar?)
2. any terminal you open will auto-activate your `.dbtenv` and each line should begin with `(.dbtenv)`

You should test this by closing VSCode, then opening the `jaffle_shop` repo

## Extensions

In this section, I'll go over some of the extensions that our team uses. Each extension requires that you install it from within VSCode, and most will require adding additional settings to your `.vscode/settings.json`

### vscode-dbt

the [vscode-dbt extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bastienboutonnet.vscode-dbt) is great because it provides a few things:
1. syntax highlighting for SQL with jinja in it (also for `.md`'s and `.yml`s), and
2. helpful jinja snippets will save you a lot of time


To get this working you should add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json`

There's an optional addition I strongly recommend `""**/target/**"": """",`, which will not do any syntax highlighting/colorization to any file in the `target/` folder. This prevents me from making the classic mistake where I start editing a compiled model file, instead of the original model file. Then when I call `dbt run` my changes aren't incorporated, but instead overwritten by the unchanged logic of the model file. with this setting you know something is wrong then the sql has no coloring.

```json
""files.associations"": {
    // the pattern on the left side can be whatever you want: e.g.
    ""**/jaffle_shop/**/*.sql"": ""jinja-sql"", // just the .sqlfiles inside of jaffle_shop, or
    ""*.sql"": ""jinja-sql"", // all .sql files

    // optional: don't format models in `target/` dir
    ""**/target/**"": """",
    // I don't personally use these, but you can also have jinja work for `yaml` and `md` files
    ""**/<dbt-project-dir>/**/*.yaml"": ""jinja-yaml"",
     ""**/<dbt-project-dir>/**/*.yml"": ""jinja-yaml"",
    ""**/<dbt-project-dir>/**/docs/**/*.md"": ""jinja-md""

    // the vscode-dbt docs say you may need this
    ""editor.quickSuggestions"": {
    ""strings"": true
    }
}
```

You'll know it is working when you open a `.sql` model and, in the bottom toolbar on the right it says now says ""Jinja SQL"" instead of ""SQL"".

### Find Related

the [find-related extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amodio.find-related) allows you to use regular expressions to correspond a `.sql` file in your `models/` directory to it's `compiled` and `run` counterparts in the `target/` folder. I find this a huge timesaver compared to manually naviagting the `target/` dir in the explorer sidebar.

After you install the `find-related` extension, you can enable it by adding the following to your `.vscode/settings.json`. There's no dbt or jinja magic going on here, just regex. So you may need to tweak these settings if they're not working for you.

Once it is set up, you can type `Option+R` on any model file to jump to it's compiled version. While on a compiled model file, `Option+R` will take you to it's `target/run` counterpart.


```json
{
    // this is so you can easily jump to your compiled SQL files
    ""findrelated.workspaceRulesets"": [
        {
            ""name"": ""sql"",
            ""rules"": [
                {
                    ""pattern"": ""^(.*/)?models/(.*/)?(.+\\.sql)$"",
                    ""locators"": [
                        ""**/compiled/**/$3""
                    ]
                },
                {
                    ""pattern"": ""^(.*/)?compiled/(.*/)?(.+\\.sql)$"",
                    ""locators"": [
                        ""**/run/**/$3""
                    ]
                },
                {
                    ""pattern"": ""^(.*/)?run/(.*/)?(.+\\.sql)$"",
                    ""locators"": [
                        ""**/models/**/$3""
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    ""findrelated.applyRulesets"": [
        ""sql""
    ]
    }
```

### Rainbow CSV

the [rainbow-csv extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) just highlights csvs where each column is it's own color. It's great to use when you have a csv where character-width varies greatly within a column. You can also hover over a value to see what column it belongs to. Very helpful for seeds!

### SQL Fluff

Our team has recently implemented sqlfluff linting for our dbt projects, especially because versions `0.6.5` and greater now support TSQL. There's also a great VCcode extenstion.

If you already have a `.sqlfluff` and `.sqlfluffignore` configured and working, it is enough to install [vscode-sqlfluff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dorzey.vscode-sqlfluff) and add the following to your `settings.json`

```json
    // you get this by calling `where sqlfluff` after calling `pip install sqlfluff`
    ""sql.linter.executablePath"": ""<PATH_TO_YOUR_SQLFLUFF_FROM_WHICH_SQLFLUFF_COMMAND"",
    ""sql.linter.run"": ""onType"" // alternatively ""onSave"" if you'd like it less frequent 
```

### dbt Power User

I personally haven't had time to use the [dbt Power User](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=innoverio.vscode-dbt-power-user) extension, but folks have good things to say. I hope to try it out soon and folks are more than welcome make a Pull Request to this doc as they see fit.

## Settings

### Extra settings
Here's some other settings that I recommend:


```json
        // easier to see if there are unsaved changed
        ""workbench.editor.highlightModifiedTabs"": true,
        ""workbench.editor.labelFormat"": ""medium"",
        // make Command Prompt the default shell for Windows instead of Powershell
        ""terminal.integrated.shell.windows"": ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"",
        
        // make a vertical line so I don't make lines too long
        ""editor.rulers"": [80],
        // show whitespace as dots
        // (easier to count out indentation and spot trailing whitesapce)
        ""editor.renderWhitespace"": ""all"",
```

### Workspace-level settings files

Sometimes it isn't convenient to have a `.vscode/settings.json`, such as when you:
1. have a subset of settings under source control that you'd like all users to be using (it doesn't make sense to source control your specific Python path)
2. you prefer [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) a.k.a. more than one repo open at at time (great for when you also want your `.dbt/profiles.yml` close at hand)

A worksapce settings file has the extension `.code-workspace` and encapsulates all the configuration you might find in a `.vscode/` dir into a single file. This file also works as a shortcut that you can double click or navigate to to bring up all your settings.

## Making sqlfluff work
To make sqlfluff work I also had to do a few extra things in addition to what you described.

Sqlfluff has multiple ways deal with jinja-sql:

1. A dbt based templater that uses dbt to compile your jinja-sql. This generates more accurate sql and automatically uses all your macros and variables, but is fairly slow.
2. Their own jinja templater, which requires extra work to make dbt work, but is very fast

In addition to that, the [vscode sqlfuff extension doesn't work with the dbt templater](https://github.com/sqlfluff/vscode-sqlfluff/issues/41).

But since the dbt templater is quite slow, it's probably not the best choice for use inside of vscode anyways.

But it also means you have to use some workarounds to make your dbt variables, macros and packages work.

### Configure sqlfluff
To configure sqlfluff I had to create two files:

#### .sqlfluff:
```ini
[sqlfluff]
# Run `sqlfluff dialects` to get a list of all dialects
dialect = tsql

# Use the dbt templater
# templater = dbt

# Use jinja templater instead of dbt
templater = jinja

[sqlfluff:templater:jinja]
# Make dbt default macros like available like `ref`
apply_dbt_builtins = true

# Load custom macros from the macro directory
load_macros_from_path = ./macros/

# Allow mocking dbt_utils and other packages through
# python files placed in this dir
library_path = ./sqlfluff_libs/

# Mock variables that are used in dbt
[sqlfluff:templater:jinja:context]
target = prod
```

#### .sqlfluffignore
```
target/
dbt_modules/
dbt_packages/
macros/
```

### Make dbt_utils work
The above config worked, but when I ran sqlfluff against a model that used `dbt_utils.surrogate_key()`, I received this error:

```
L:   1 | P:   1 |  TMP | Unrecoverable failure in Jinja templating: 'dbt_utils'
                       | is undefined. Have you configured your variables?
                       | https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/latest/configuration.html
L:  17 | P:  12 |  TMP | Undefined jinja template variable: 'dbt_utils'
```

I was able to fix it by creating a python library that mocks dbt_utils package macros:

#### sqlfluff_libs/dbt_utils.py:
```python
def surrogate_key(field_list):
    return ""'0xMockKey'""
```

To mock more complex and nested libraries, you can refer to:
https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/configuration.html#library-templating


### A broken link...
I also noticed the link `a gist for an example .vscode directory` doesn't seem to work, because you changed your github name. 

The working link is: https://gist.github.com/dataders/5cf876d88c7c8d268d8c1e1e5d05bffd",4

Its been a while since this thread has been updated, and I just wanted to say that the best way (IMHO) to setup dbt to work with vscode has been to install the [dbt-power-user extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=innoverio.vscode-dbt-power-user) along with some other extensions like sqlfluff, vscode-dbt, rainbow-csv etc. 

**[self promo warning]** For those using Big Query, however, I'd like to present my vscode extension, [vscode-dbt-bigquery-power-user](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=butchland.vscode-dbt-bigquery-power-user) which integrates an sql results preview pane 
![query-runner-screenshot|664x500, 75%](upload://ht2VawvhgVbDXmilH88izKQy7d.png)


Its actually a fork of the dbt-power-user extension plus some other extensions ([vscode-bigquery](https://github.com/google/vscode-bigquery) and [vscode-query-runner](https://github.com/tadyjp/vscode-query-runner) which I integrated into this plus some of my own bag of tricks.

Some of the highlights of this extension are:
* A **Show Compiled SQL** menu icon that opens the compiled sql version of your models

* An **Open Query Runner** menu icon that runs the compiled sql and displays the results in another panel

* The **Query Runner** panel that displays the results of the query.
    - The **Rerun Query** button which allows you to update the model in your original panel and rerun the query (including the compilation) as well as the **Results navigation** buttons to see the next/prev page of results.
   - The **Download** buttons which allow to display the results  (with a choice of JSON, text, or csv formats)  as well as download the data into the `logs/results` folder of the dbt-project.

Its still in _alpha release_, meaning it hasn't been tested extensively but I've been dogfooding it in my own side projects, and I'm now looking for more feedback. 

For those vscode users using dbt with bigquery , I hope you find it useful and [give me some feedback](https://github.com/butchland/vscode-dbt-bigquery-power-user/issues).",5

tl;dr: Use tools in your existing stack (MDS), dbt artifacts, and your query log to build reporting and alerts on dbt model/job runs and performance

## Introduction
We undertook this project to answer questions analytics engineers have about their dbt models, tests, and pipelines. The questions we often heard were: 
- Why isn't my model up to date?
- How long did my model take to run?
- When is the last time my model ran?
- Is my data accurate? Did my tests pass?
- Why are my models taking so long to build?

There wasn't an easy way to answer these questions without going into several services or SaaS tools, or painstakingly debugging logs. 

We decided to build a system that would help answer these questions in an automated and proactive manner. Applying the ""[jobs to be done](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done)"" framework, with analytics engineers were our customers, we set out to create a system that would perform the following jobs:
- Send alerts to individual model owners based on custom criteria (e.g. run or test failures)
- Surface key information about model and job-level executions, like model runtimes and freshness
- Identify models in need of optimization and bottlenecks in dbt pipelines
- Reliably collect metadata for *all* production pipelines in quasi-realtime, including after failures

Our guiding principles for this project were making the system:
1. **Lightweight** — deploy the system easily using tools in the modern data stack
2. **Flexible** — explore, report, and alert on metadata using SQL
3. **Exhaustive** — support all dbt resources, artifacts, and command types (e.g. run, test, build)

## Architecture

Our system comprises four distinct parts:
1. **Orchestration**
    - dbt pipelines are orchestrated using Airflow and KubernetesPodOperator tasks
        1. Example: `dbt run -s tag:hourly`
2. **Metadata**
    - Artifacts are loaded into Snowflake at the end of every pipeline, even if the dbt pipeline resulted in a failure
        - Example: `dbt run -s tag:hourly; dbt run-operation upload_artifacts —args run_results`
3. **Modelling**
    - Artifacts are modelled and joined to the manifest using dbt
        - Example: `stg_dbt_run_results`
4. **Reporting and Alerting**
    - dbt artifacts are brought into Looker and displayed in dashboards. Alerts are set up to fire directly to specific people based on Slack user groups.
        - Example: Alert @finance-domain on all model run and test failures with `tag:finance` in the last 15 minutes

### Orchestration

Our dbt deployment consists of three types of models: Hourly, nightly, and external. Each model in our project can only have one of these **deployment tags**. Hourly and nightly models are managed in their respective pipelines, which look like this:

![image|690x62](upload://4FzGTd6yi0P2gAXUVdJeLW7SIzK.png)
![image|690x42](upload://r8tdHYsoIXUK07OpcNENhIIsRyC.png)

External dbt models refer to models managed outside of the hourly and nightly jobs. An external pipeline might be structured like this:
```copy_myreport_to_s3 >> load_myreport_to_snowflake >> run_myreport_dbt_models```

We ensure that there is no duplication across hourly/nightly and external pipelines by using intersection selectors. For example, an ""external"" dbt job runs models at the intersection between the source's downstream models and `tag:external`, e.g.:

 `dbt run -s source.myreport+, tag:external`

In Airflow, we use the KubernetesPodOperator to execute these dbt commands in a single task, rather than splitting up into separate tasks as [some teams do](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/airflow-dbt-1).

```bash
dbt_nightly_run = KubernetesPodOperator(
  **snaptravel_defaults,
  **dbt_defaults,
  task_id='dbt_nightly_run_task',
  name=""dbt-nightly-run-task"",
  arguments=dbt_run_commands,
  dag=dag
  )
```

### Metadata
We created a macro to upload dbt artifacts directly to Snowflake from the Airflow worker node's local disk. We first load data to a Snowflake stage using a `PUT` command:

```sql
{% set put_query %}
    PUT file://target/run_results.json @RAW.DBT.DBT_LOAD auto_compress=true;
{% endset %}
{% do run_query(put_query) %}
```

Then, we copy the file from the stage the respective dbt artifacts table using `COPY` :

```sql
{% set copy_query %}
    BEGIN;
    COPY INTO RAW.DBT.RUN_RESULTS FROM
        @RAW.DBT.DBT_LOAD
        file_format=(type='JSON')
        on_error='skip_file';
    COMMIT;
{% endset %}
{% do run_query(copy_query) %}
```
Then we remove data from the stage:

```bash
{% set remove_query %}
    REMOVE @{{ database }}.DBT.DBT_LOAD pattern='.*.json.gz';
{% endset %}

```
We run this macro after every dbt job in Airflow, using a command structure like the following:

```bash
dbt run -m tag:hourly; ret=$?;
dbt run-operation upload_dbt_artifacts --args 'run_results'; exit $ret
```
This ensures that artifacts are uploaded even if the first command returns a failure, as a result of a failing test, for example.

### Modelling

Once the artifacts land in Snowflake, they're modelled using dbt so they can be used for reporting, analysis, and alerting on our dbt pipelines and model performance. 

Much of this can be done automatically now using the [Tails.com](http://Tails.com) [dbt_artifacts](https://github.com/tailsdotcom/dbt_artifacts) package, which didn't exist when we began this project. We did use the Gitlab data team's [open source analytics repo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/tree/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/models/workspaces/workspace_data/dbt) for a lot of our initial code, and we are very grateful to them!

The full dbt DAG for artifacts looks like this:
**![|938px;x269px;](upload://9jV1BLCHvR3xbcii8M71m1Flwtm.png)**

The most relevant model joins the  `run_results` artifact, `manifest` artifact, and Snowflake query history. The query history allows us to calculated the estimated cost of every dbt model and pipeline run. It also gives us key query performance metrics like **byte spillage** and **partitions scanned** at the model level, which helps us identify poorly performing models.

We join artifacts to the query log using a query comment:

```bash
query-comment:
  comment: ""{{ query_comment(node) }}""
  append: true
```

The query comment macro is taken directly from the [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/query-comment#advanced-use-a-macro-to-generate-a-comment), with small modifications. The fields `node_id` and  `invocation_id `allow us to join artifact instances to the underlying queries.

```bash
{% macro query_comment(node) %}
    {%- set comment_dict = {} -%}
    {%- do comment_dict.update(
        app='dbt',
        dbt_version=dbt_version,
        profile_name=target.get('profile_name'),
        target_name=target.get('target_name'),
        invocation_id=invocation_id
    ) -%}
    {%- if node is not none -%}
      {%- do comment_dict.update(
        file=node.original_file_path,
        node_id=node.unique_id,
        node_name=node.name,
        resource_type=node.resource_type,
        package_name=node.package_name,
        relation={
            ""database"": node.database,
            ""schema"": node.schema,
            ""identifier"": node.identifier,
	        ""materialized"": node.config.get('materialized')
        }
      ) -%}
    {% else %}
      {%- do comment_dict.update(node_id='internal') -%}
    {%- endif -%}
    {% do return(tojson(comment_dict)) %}
{% endmacro %}
```

We use four types of models in our dbt project. Views and tables are single CREATE statements and can be mapped 1:1 with a query in the query history. Insert by period and incremental models have multiple queries associated with them, so for these we aggregate relevant metrics in the query history (e.g. `bytes_spilled` becomes `total_bytes_spilled` across all model queries). 

We use our snowflake contract rate and the estimated credits used per query to calculate our estimated cost per query:

```bash
CASE
  WHEN group_queries.warehouse_size = 'XSMALL'
    THEN 1
  WHEN group_queries.warehouse_size = 'SMALL'
    THEN 2
  WHEN group_queries.warehouse_size = 'MEDIUM'
    THEN 4
  WHEN group_queries.warehouse_size = 'LARGE'
    THEN 8
  WHEN group_queries.warehouse_size = 'XLARGE'
    THEN 16
  WHEN group_queries.warehouse_size = 'XXLARGE'
    THEN 32
  WHEN group_queries.warehouse_size = 'XXXLARGE'
    THEN 64
  WHEN group_queries.warehouse_size = 'XXXXLARGE'
    THEN 128
END                                                        AS warehouse_credits_hourly,
total_elapsed_time_mins * warehouse_credits_hourly / 60    AS est_credits_used,
{{ var('snowflake_contract_rate') }} * est_credits_used    AS est_cost
```
### Reporting and Alerting

dbt artifacts are brought into Looker and displayed in dashboards. The first use case is alerting on model run and test failures. 
#### Failures

One of our main objectives was sending alerts directly to individual model owners. To accomplish this, we require every model to be tagged with a single domain tag — finance, growth, product, etc. We construct charts for each domain's model runs like the one below, which shows the most recent runs of every model tagged `finance`
![Untitled|660x361](upload://n97g5uW7Tx2HArQgmV4voEY23FM.png)

A Looker alert on this chart runs every 15 minutes, and if there's a failed run, a notification is sent to our #data-alerts slack channel tagging the slack user group @finance-domain. Once an alert fires, a domain member goes to the dashboard, fetches the compiled SQL, and starts debugging. The same occurs for tests, snapshots, source freshness failures, etc.:
![Untitled|690x214](upload://zF8J5vQNnTXvvxnLeaZT2AcW2y1.png)

#### Model Performance
We also show data relevant to model performance. We can easily see the models which take the longest along with their key query performance metrics. These metrics help us determine when a model's materialization should be updated, or when the warehouse size should be increased. For example, let's look at a subset of our models:
![Untitled|690x186](upload://xwKSDjaY7jsPt5EcrvD4uzyqmKH.jpeg)

There are three main action items one can take from this view, beyond simple optimization and SQL refactoring:
1. **Materialization:** If the model is taking a long time to build, it may be worth exploring a new materialization strategy, like an incremental or insert_by_period
2. **Clustering**: If the model is taking a long time to build and a high percentage of total partitions are being scanned, it may be worthwhile to explore new cluster keys
3. **Warehouse**: If the model tends to have a lot of spillage and bytes sent over the network , it may be worthwhile to simply increase the size of the warehouse, once other opportunities for optimization have been exhausted.

Analytics engineers can also view models individually across time:
![dbt_supply_bucketed_lmp|690x187](upload://XQ58YuK24xWWMnDoqAg9UVQI42.gif)
![Untitled|690x321](upload://hPDh3tMfAzNcqHxcKThPOeYkcWn.png)
![Untitled|690x346](upload://lLDCJp7Ytl8XgvJDi7k5YvlPXcr.jpeg)
#### Job Performance
Finally, we can evaluate job-level performance and identify pipeline bottlenecks using Gantt charts, inspired by @claire's [post](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/analyzing-fishtowns-dbt-project-performance-with-artifacts/2214) about the dbt project at dbt labs.

When the hourly or nightly jobs begin to take longer than expected, this view can help identify areas for optimization to keep them within SLA. Here are examples of our core hourly and nightly jobs:

Over the past few months, I have been hacking away at that tool, and today it works with dbt jinja and creates well-formatted, modern-looking SQL. It's not a linter (use SQLFluff for that) -- it just does one thing and does it well.

You can try it at [sqlfmt.com](http://sqlfmt.com/), or check out the [repo on Github](https://github.com/tconbeer/sqlfmt). Or if you like to live dangerously, `pipx install shandy-sqlfmt` 

It's still really early innings. There are more features and integrations I'd like to build (and I'm sure plenty of bugs yet to be found). I would really, really value any contribution from this community, whether that's feedback, an issue, or a PR. Thanks for checking it out; please let me know what you think!",1

3821,"managing-hundreds-of-schemas-in-the-dbt-project-yml","We also deal with hundreds of schemas but we use BigQuery – so we don't need to define the schemas in `dbt_project.yml`. :thinking: 

All schemas contain the same set of tables and columns and they all follow the pattern `schema_ORG`.

We combine ""raw"" tables from all ""schemas"" (aka ""organizations"") into one table under the `raw` dataset. We created a dbt macro to combine them all into one view. Ex:

```sql
# models/raw/raw_users.sql
{{
combine_organization_tables(
  'users',
  ['id', 'team_id']
)
}}
```

The macro:
1. pulls the list of ORG from `public_organizations`
2. pulls the list of columns from one of the `ORG`. Ex: `acme.users`
3. builds a view that UNION ALL the tables from all ORGs:
3.1 we add one extra column `org` to be able to scope queries down to a specific organization
3.2 we prefix all `id` columns (here: `id` and `team_id`) with the `org` to prevent conflicts. Ex: `acme/123`

So for example, `raw_users` is:

```
org    | id        | name        | team_id        |
acme   | acme/123  | angela      | acme/300       |
acme   | acme/124  | chris       | acme/400       |

This is well-illustrated when you look at the DAG that dbt docs creates: 
![image|690x166](upload://5uJLrlclKXUbmN7YYLEfK8YBLop.png)

In this example, `jafflegaggle_contacts` is highlighted in purple. Relative to it, the 5 event and user models are upstream, and `jafflegaggle_facts` and `jafflegaggle_corporate_accounts` are downstream. 

If we instead use `stg_users` as our reference point, then only `raw_user` is upstream. Now `jafflegaggle_contacts` is considered downstream (along with its descendants).

You might also consider BI tools that query your final marts to be ""downstream tools"" or ""downstream consumers"", and data sources such as your CRM to be an ""upstream source"".",2

4481,"breaking-a-large-query-into-parallelized-partitioned-queries","We have a long-running model that performs a complex set of geospatial comparisons to get point-to-point distances between every person in the US and a list of around 300K points of interest. We are using snowflake, and using snowflake's geospatial data types and functions. We also do restrict the comparisons, so we are not (for instance) calculating distances between people in New York with POI in Los Angeles. Regardless, the first pass at the model took over 24 hours to execute on a large snowflake warehouse. This first pass was not implemented in dbt. We then tried essentially partitioning the query into multiple queries, each running a separate region of the country, executing in parallel. This reduced the overall execution time by around 50%, with approximately the same credit burn on snowflake. This also was not in dbt. The orchestration was simply a python script that fired off the regional queries in parallel.

We want to move this model into dbt, but are a little stuck on how to accomplish the parallelism bit. Based on my understanding of dbt, since this is technically a single model, resulting in a single table, it would not ""natively"" be able to be parallelized the way described. One thought we have is to create separate models for different geographic regions, which can execute in parallel (via dbt threads), with downstream union to get at the final data set. But, if we were to decide that we wanted change our geographic ""partitioning"", that then would mean creating or removing intermediate models. Depending on how small we determined our geographic regions needed to be, it also could require quite a lot of intermediate models. Are there other options we are not thinking of?",1
4481,"breaking-a-large-query-into-parallelized-partitioned-queries","Not simple, but you could also implement the partitioning logic as a custom materialization. See https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/legacy/creating-new-materializations

4481,"breaking-a-large-query-into-parallelized-partitioned-queries","Are you re-calculating the entire dataset on every invocation? How much of it changes between two runs and how often do you run it? 

Where I'm going with this is that you might consider an [incremental model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/configuring-incremental-models). By doing this, you would pay the large calculation cost once, but would then only have to calculate the changes from there. 

If you have a table showing users' locations and when they last changed, it might look something like 

```sql
{% config(materialized='incremental', unique_key='user_location_key') %}

4481,"breaking-a-large-query-into-parallelized-partitioned-queries","I should check back for replies to my questions more often :slight_smile: . In our current use case, we do have to fully rebuild the data set on each execution, as this model gets re-run when we get fully new underlying data sets. We might be able to implement an incremental approach, but I think the returns on investment there would be limited because the two input base data sets can change drastically between runs. 

As for the idea of a custom materialization, I am very interested in looking in to that. Actually started looking in to it today, taking the existing implementation for the table materialization and starting to fiddle with it. So far, approach is to derive the partition values from the source (or hard code them in, for dev purposes), use the model sql as a basis to define a temporary relation for each partition (suffixed with the partition value), populate it (applying the partitioning on the data while populating its specific temp relation), and then union the list of temp relations returning the target final relation. However, what I cannot figure out is how to get the temp partitions to execute in parallel to get the scalability I'm really looking for. Anyway, only a couple of hours put in to it, will post back if I end up making it work.

4481,"breaking-a-large-query-into-parallelized-partitioned-queries","That approach sounds reasonable! I'm _pretty sure_ that you'll find that although dbt is multithreaded and can do parallel processing, its granularity is at the model level. So the temp partitions likely won't execute in parallel unless you can find a way to fire off multiple builds in some sort of other task in Snowflake (and then you'd need some way to poll to know whether they're all finished or not). 

I don't know enough about Snowflake to know if that sort of thing is possible; interested to hear how you get on!

As I understand it, parallel processing is *the* reason folks go through the trouble of writing PySpark code, rather than just single-node Pandas.

Snowpark also supports this explicitly via its ""batch API,"" by adding the `@vectorized` decorator to a UDF. It will apply the function over batches of rows/series (in parallel): https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/python/udf-python-batch.html. Though I'm not sure if you can tell it *how* to batch the data (by region), to restrict the comparisons — beyond just specifying the batch size. If the source table is clustered on country, though...?

I'd *hope* that the execution engine is smart enough to handle that parallelism itself.

I would like to run dbt through Cloud Composer (which is the GCP's managed service for Apache Airflow) and I am struggling to find a proper and secure way in order to authenticate dbt so that it can perform operations on Google Cloud BigQuery.

      priority: interactive
      project: my-gcp-project
      threads: 4
      type: bigquery
  target: dev
```

Where am I supposed to store the service account JSON key in order to be visible to `dbt` when running it through Cloud Composer?
 
One option is to place the JSON key file on Cloud Storage, under `gs://<cloud-composer-bucket>/data` which is mounted into every Airflow worker and simply use the `/home/airflow/gcs/service-account-key.json` for `keyfile` on `dbt`'s profile but I don't think this is a secure enough approach (i.e. storing the service account key on an object storage such as GCS). 

PS: Note that I am not using Secret Manager on GCP, but self-hosted HashiCorp Vault instead.

You could use a hash with even more entropy, like SHA2, but if you have enough data to be concerned about MD5 collisions, then the performance penalty of a different hash is probably also going to be a concern.

I am refactoring some legacy SQL codebase at my company and after reading ""[How we structure our dbt projects](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview)"", something does not click for me regarding intermediate models.

I have a case where 2 marts models have a big portion of repeated code in a CTE. Actually, the person who wrote the code even created a temporary table (we're using BQ) for this CTE. So this same TEMP table is created 2 times in 2 different models.

To me, the logical thing to do was to move this repeated piece of code in an intermediate model that would be ref'ed by the 2 marts models. However, the [chapter of the guide regarding Intermediate Models](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/3-intermediate) advocates for a 1 to 1 relationship between intermediate and mart models.

I understand that if I would move my CTE into an ""ephemeral"" intermediate model (as it is recommended), we would compute the same thing twice. However, according to the guidelines, I don't see where else this code should live.

Of course guidelines are just guidelines but I'm curious as to  what is the dbt way to handle this. Moving it to a mart model even if it's not really aimed to end users? And what about CTEs that are reused in many different models?

Thanks!",1

4780,"repeated-ctes-dry-and-intermediate-models-good-practice","Hi @Thmsrey! Winnie here, writer of the ""How we structure"" Guide. First off, thank you for reading it thoughtfully! Secondly, this is a *really* good question.

This is the squishiest part of the guide, and the set of recommendations I'm the least satisfied with how I communicated. It needs more examples.

My biggest overarching response is: as you said, guidelines are just guidelines, and everybody breaks this one when needed. Almost every dbt installation will have some instance where they need to reuse intermediate models in multiple marts, so don't feel like you're necessarily breaking the rules if this particular group of models is that area for y'all.

All that said, let me elaborate a bit on the goal of this recommendation and how I think about it:
- I've seen a lot of people re-use all of their intermediate models in like 10 models each, this creates this really gnarly set of dependencies that makes your DAG difficult to reason about **and** duplicates tons of data in your warehouse. Storage is cheap so that's not the end of the world, but if it's expensive compute-wise you could be needlessly computing transformations over and over again.
- What I prefer to do is *layer my marts*. So you mention these tables reuse this big complex CTE for example. I would consider importing it into one of the marts. Then importing that mart into the other mart that needs those transformations, and just select the columns that overlap. This keeps the dependency chain in the DAG really clear, and means I'm only processing that set of transformations one time.

Let me know if that makes sense! Again, there are always scenarios where this isn't ideal, but I push people to think through this option first before they start plugging intermediate models all over the place and tangling up their DAG.

Happy modeling!",4

In general, you probably shouldn't need to though as they're small files, so even if the seed isn't on the same node it would be trivial for Redshift to copy it over. 

With that said, if you do need to configure this then there's a workaround: you could make a model that just passes the seed through:
```sql
-- models/my_seed_with_dist_key_set.sql
{{ config(materialized='table',  sort='id',  dist='received_at') }}

select * from {{ ref('my_seed') }}

How much transformation and cleaning is happening in Python before they're being loaded to the database, and does your team control that process directly? If the data is already in a perfect format for analysis, and that format isn't going to change <s>ever</s> for a long time, you could probably get away with loading it directly into a `staging` db. 

""Could probably get away with"" is not exactly inspiring though! On the whole, I'd recommend still loading it into a separate `raw` database. Your staging layer might wind up being `select * from ""raw"".""pipelines"".""web""` for now, but it maintains optionality if your data format changes in the future - you can make changes in your staging layer to maintain the interface/contract that your marts rely on.",2

dbt supports (and strongly encourages!) taking multiple source tables and turning them into a single transformed mart table. It doesn't support building multiple output tables from a single model file, but I don't _think_ that's what you're referring to.

If you use a traditional view where the underlying tables are accessed live on every query, then dbt would work great for that.

4922,"snowflake-cluster-keys-in-dbt-learnings-and-thoughts","My data engineering team has recently been working on converting the generation/maintenance of some very large data sets that our data science team has been managing. We use snowflake, and for many of our large data sets we define custom cluster keys on the tables. As we have been working on these conversions, the query times for producing some of these large models (dozens of billions of rows) were far longer than we had expected. Examination of the query plans showed that the longest step was a sort on the full data set, which is not something that we had in our dbt model definition. After some digging, we discovered that this is a product of how dbt decided to handle snowflake clustering. 

References:

https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/634
https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs#configuring-table-clustering

Basically, dbt takes advantage of the fact that if you insert sorted data to an empty table (or as part of a ctas), and then apply clustering on the same sort keys, then the data is already clustered by default. So if you have added the ""cluster by"" config to your model, when the model gets compiled, dbt adds a sort on the cluster key(s) to the end of the sql. This decision appears to have been made partially in response to the fact that snowflake's normal clustering mechanism involves a background process that reorganizes the underlying data for clustered data sets until they are close to optimal, and that process does have expense ($$) associated with it. 

Another way to think about it is that dbt enforces immediate consistency on clustered tables, while normally you would have eventual consistency. This makes sense in the context of a dbt process on its own: presumably you have clustered your data to make it more efficient to use it downstream, and in a dbt process presumably your downstream use is right away, so you want immediate consistency.

However, in our use case, we do actually want eventual consistency...we want to leverage snowflake's background process. The trade off we are making is that we want the dbt process to run faster, with the knowledge that at some point in time later on people will be leveraging the outputs, and they want it clustered.

Anyway, we thought those were some really interesting ""down in the weeds"" details on how dbt snowflake clustering actually works, and wanted to share with the community.

Also, our solution for our particular case is now to not the ""cluster by"" config to apply the clustering to our models, but instead to apply them via a post-hook. That way dbt does not compile in the sort on the data set, but we still get that ""eventual consistency"" behavior.",1

Yes you got it! When you're inside of curly braces, you don't need another set of curlies around your variables.

4936,"creating-dynamic-queries-with-jinja-and-model-yml-files","### Problem Context:
We have various fields that we do/don’t want to surface to end users in Looker for any given transformation. However, the fields are necessary for transformation logic. In a gross sense, our query relationships goes `staging` → `transformation` → `surface only selected fields to visualization tools ('Clean')`. However, manually maintaining our `Clean` queries is growing into a bit of a pain, and we’ve run into some frustrating situations doing so. A key part of this is that we don't want to actually maintain the SQL in the `Clean` queries.
We also have limited resources to implement this from a BigQuery or Infra side of things, so we had to do this only with what DBT has to offer.

### Solution
We have added a property to every column entry, that we can read via Jinja. This greatly simplifies things, as we already document each column, both as a matter of good practice, and to centralize documentation in DBT--all of our descriptions are written to BQ, and Looker now has the capability to import the descriptions into LookML when creating view files. Part of the design of this is to operate on an allow-list basis--the column must have the property, and the property must = `true`. At some point, a column must be defined as being allowed/not allowed, and we decided that dbt is right place for us, given our constraints.

I had avoided using the `tags` hierarchy, as the .yml files were getting pretty big.

An example of the `model.yml`:
```
version: 2

models:
  - name: upstream_query
    description: ""blablabla""
    columns:
    - name: field_1
      description: ""blablabla""
      is_allowed: true
    - name: field_2
      description: ""blablabla""
      is_allowed: false
    - name: field_3
      description: ""blablabla""
      is_allowed: true
```
  
The macro:
```
{% macro get_allowed_columns_macro(tablename) -%}
	{% if execute %}
		{%- set column_list = [] -%}
		{%- for node in graph.nodes.values() -%}
			{%- if node.name == tablename -%}
				{%- for column, properties in node.columns.items() -%}
					{%- do column_list.append(column) if properties.get('is_allowed') == true -%}
				{%- endfor -%}
			{%- endif -%}
		{%- endfor %}
		{{ return(column_list) }}
	{% endif %}
{%- endmacro %}
```

An example query:
```
/* Define the table you are referring to */
{% set tableref = 'upstream_query' -%}
/* Create a [list] of columns that are flagged as field_name == true */
{% set allowed_columns = get_allowed_columns_macro(tableref) -%}

SELECT
{%- for columns in allowed_columns -%}
{%- if not loop.first %}
, {{ columns }}
{%- else %}
{{ columns }}
{%- endif -%}
{%- endfor %}

FROM {{ ref(tableref) }}
```

Which will compile to:
```
SELECT
field_1
, field_3

FROM `database.dataset.upstream_query`

4942,"using-python-to-update-model-schema-yml-files-and-create-staging-files-bigquery-specific","Howdy folks, this is a long post--I didn't want to make multiple posts. Also, happy for input on the Python, in case you think it could be improved :slight_smile: 

# 1. Updating model_schema.yml Files Using Python

### Background
Analysts are required to be on top of updating `model_schema.yml` files. I wrote a Python script that will update the `model_schema.yml` for the analyst, after they have modified & run a query. This is very helpful, especially for documenting queries that are dynamically generated using Jinja loops or similar, where one can end up with a large number of relatively-dynamic columns. I have used `ruamel.yaml`--I found that the common `PyYAML` to not be sufficient for my purposes, as I found the ruamel round-trip formatting and export to be much superior.

This codes uses ruamel v0.17.21, found here: https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/0.17.21/
1. `pip install -U pip setuptools wheel`
2. `pip install ruamel.yaml==0.17.21`

### Some Important Notes
A few notes about the limitations of this code:
1. This code requires the analyst to have run the query recently--it operates off of the columns it finds in the database from the analyst's development run environment.
2. This code is specific to BigQuery,
3. This code assumes that all `model_schema.yml` files follow the same naming structure, ex: `models_schema__invoices.yml`, `models_schema__customers.yml`, .....
4. This code preserves any existing `description` or other parameters present in YAML entries
5. It assumes that all `description` fields are double-quoted ex. `description: ""Hello world!""`

### How the code works
1. Prompt user for the name of query they modified
2. Search across `model_schema.yml` files across the project
3. Identify where the entry exists: Note: there must be an entry for the query, and at least 1 column defined
4. Query against the analyst’s development output, to identify columns that will be seen in production
5. Check if it should keep, drop, or add existing column entries
6. Write the updated query+column fields to the appropriate YAML file

As a side note, updating YAML in-place was a massive pain, but it didn’t seem to be a common thing on the internet. This is my hacky solution--happy to hear if folks have a better way of approaching this.

At the moment, this code must be manually triggered by the analyst. In a nice future state, this would be triggered by git-commit actions, and it would automagically search for modified queries, update the relevant yaml, and prompt the user to update relevant documentation parameters in the yaml.

### Minimum amount of yml necessary for the code to successfully execute
This code works for both net-new and existing yml entries. However, it needs the analyst to start the net-new entry--the intent of this is that it focuses more on dynamically updating existing entries, so the analyst doesn't have to go digging through folder structure as often.

```
version: 2

models:
  - name: query_you_modified
    columns:
      - name: need_at_least_1_field
        description: ""If net-new, just put in a fake field name, as it will be dropped and replaced with the proper fields.""
```

Creating staging files can be a pain in the neck, when you have a lot to import, especially when you're creating a new project, connecting to a new dataset, or exposing a bunch of new tables from an existing dataset. I know that there are some Jinja-based utils to streamline this, but it still means you have to manually create the files. We also run into the situation where you have a number of staging files already imported, but you need to add some new ones due to a new product feature release, but you don't want to overwrite the existing staging files.

### How it works

Note that this script is specific to our idiosyncratic DBT setup--we have our staging files set up in a particular way to deal with some data concerns regarding PII/PHI, due to our work with healthcare-related data.
Our specific design choices:
1. Each underlying table is initially declared as a staging file
2. Each field is explicitly declared
3. We only perform minor name and datatype changes in staging files
4. Each staging file follows a particular pattern: `stg_datasourcefolder__table_name.sql` ex. `stg_salesforce__user.sql` or `stg_internal_api_replica__user.sql`. You can feel free to modify the code to match your naming strategy.


### Python Code
My design patterns/baked-in assumptions for this code:
1. The user should be able to decide if they're overwriting existing staging files, or only importing net-new ones
2. It should ensure that BigQuery reserved keywords are modified.
3. Any `id` fields are PKs, and should be renamed to `table_name_id`
4. We only want to allow specific datatypes
5. We have a recognizable pattern to how your staging folders are structured
6. Source YAML files will have to be manually edited--dynamically editing these files was out of scope for this project, but future iterations will include concepts from the first part of this document for that.

This code assumes that your folder structure follows something similar to this:
* models
  * staging
    * fivetran
        * fivetransource_1
           * `stg_fivetransource_1__table1.sql`
              `stg_fivetransource_1__table2.sql`
         * fivetransource_2
           .....
    * internal_api
        * internal_apisource_1
           * `stg_internal_apisource_1__table1.sql`
              `stg_internal_apisource_1__table2.sql`
         * internal_apisource_2
          .....


I know that this is perhaps not 100% the favored DBT structure, but this is what we have ended up with, due to some internal design and resource constraints. 

I also had this code with user prompts, but that got a little complicated, so I have trimmed it down for this exercise--you have to manually update the variables.

Regards,",1
4944,"pass-table-column-values-to-macro","Hi @dinesh.rupchandani, the code you've posted looks basically correct, however you don't need to wrap your concat_macro call in the `'` at the start/end of the line - that will result in a quoted string like `'col1 || col2'`. With the quotes removed, I would expect your code to render as 
```
with test as
(
select ‘abc’ as col1, ‘xyz’ as col2 union
select ‘ggg’ as col1, ‘xxx’ as col2
)
select col1,col2,
col1 || col2 as column1 
from test
```

If that's not what you're seeing, can you share the `concat_macro()` that you've written? Perhaps there is an issue in your macro code instead of in the model you posted. 

Or, are you asking whether there is a sample concatenation macro already written? You can use [`{{ dbt.concat() }}`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/cross-database-macros#concat).",2
4944,"pass-table-column-values-to-macro","Hi @dinesh.rupchandani thanks for updating the post - it's easier to click the <kbd>Reply</kbd> button and add an additional post though! 

Looking at the macro you provided:
 ```
{% macro concat_macro(col1,col2) %}
    {% set tmp = col1+col2 %}
    {{ tmp }}
{% endmacro %}
```

by creating a `tmp` variable you are creating a string which is just the two inputs combined, instead of creating a command for Snowflake to concatenate the two columns.  

Since you're using Snowflake, the correct syntax for concatenation is `concat()` or `||`: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/concat.html. This doesn't necessarily need to be a macro as it's pretty standard behaviour: 

```
select     
    'abc' as col1, 
    'def' as col2, 
    col1 || col2 as combined
```

But if you wanted to do it anyway as an experiment then this would be better: 
```
{% macro concat(val1, val2) %}
    {{ val1 }} || {{ val2 }}
{% endmacro %}
```
Note that this macro would only support two arguments, you wouldn't be able to concatenate 3 columns together (which is why [the native one linked above](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/cross-database-macros#concat) is better)

4954,"what-can-i-use-to-load-monthly-updating-excel-files-to-database","Hello everyone!

Each month, we have a number of Excel files that have ~20-60K rows that need to be uploaded to the database as tables that are then used in downstream data models. They require some light data cleaning before loading in, which are currently done using Python but can be done using SQL when we stage them. I'm conflicted as to whether to use seeds for this:

Reasons against using seeds

* These files are larger than the ~1k row recommended in the seeds docs
* While these Excel files can be saved as CSVs before uploading, this sometimes leads to loss of column data type
* These files are updated monthly, which might not be ""infrequent"" as recommended in the seeds docs
* These files need to be renamed to give the proper table name, which losses the ""lineage"" of what the name of the original file was that created this data table

Reasons  for using seeds
* It would be great to version control the data files that created the tables, which seeds would allow us to do

If seeds are not the appropriate method, what would be the recommended workflow for loading Excel files into the database?

Really appreciate any thoughts on this! Thank you very much!",1
4954,"what-can-i-use-to-load-monthly-updating-excel-files-to-database","Hey @nancy.chelaru, this is a great question and you're definitely thinking about it in the right way! 

I agree that you shouldn't use seeds. When you say you need to version control the data files, what part of the version control process is most important to you? 
- If you need to track changes to the file over time, using [dbt snapshots](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/snapshots) might be a good approach. 
- If you need to be able to block changes to the file, subject to a process similar to code review, we'd have to think about it a bit more and it would depend on the specific tool you ultimately choose.

Which database platform and ingestion tools do you already use? Ingestion tools like Fivetran and Stitch have the ability to ingest data from a Google Sheet or a folder in Google Drive/Box/Dropbox, or to upload a file directly. They tend to need to be csv files so the issue you raised about column datatypes remains true, although [Fivetran's browser uploader](https://fivetran.com/docs/files/browser-upload) supports changing the column type inline. 

If you're using Snowflake, it also has a [web-based loader](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-web-ui.html); BigQuery can [read from Google Drive or Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/external-data-drive); Redshift can [copy data over from S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/tutorial-loading-data.html) (you'll probably want to use our [Redshift package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/redshift) to help with this). 

That's a lot of options and the advice is pretty generic - if you let me know what tools you're already using, we can get a bit more specific.",2

From Excel, save the data as csv, From Power Automate Desktop (PAD) CSV Upload dialog, you pick the file, set the few options such as split file, create format, create stage, create table, then upload. This will create all the objects in snowflake and upload the data very quickly. Then call or create another script to do the ETL in snowflake.
It uses the snowflake cli from Windows machine.

do you know if there is any support in dbt to deploy changes to a tables data model without dropping and re-creating the table? I would like to have an automated comparison of the table's DLL in dbt with the existing table structure in the database that generates ""alter table add / modify / drop column"" statements.

You may want to use dummy dbt objects to have manual control over your legacy/unsupported/etc. underlying object.

"" for example if we want to manage a DBT table with the name ""not_supported_sql_server_temporal_table"" we make an auxiliary DBT model ""not_supported_sql_server_temporal_table_dbt"" and do all the DML and DDL and other stuff in hooks, even SP and exec SP. In hooks correspondingly we use [{{this.schema}}].[{{this.table!replace('_dbt','')}}] reference.  Despite having the overhead of having these dummy _dbt objects the approach delivers tremendous management relief in several areas. Previously we considered using SSDT/
redgate/flyway/liquibase as well""

Do you have access to another database query tool, e.g. DataGrip or even the [AWS Redshift Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/query-editor.html)? If so, you can check there. The reason I suggest these is that if you have a more powerful account you can use to access those then you can confirm whether the model exists even if your dbt user doesn’t have access.

My other suggestion is that I noticed in your screenshot you have a lot of custom code. It might be worth going back to the default code ([you can find it here if you need it](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-starter-project)) and making sure that works before continuing on. That way you can check whether the problem is your database connection etc or a mistake in your model itself.",5

dbt does not currently have native support for materialized views. The different warehouses/data platforms don't have consistent implementations for materialized views yet so it's not practical for us to build an abstraction over them. There is a [sample package here with demo code](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-labs-experimental-features/tree/main/materialized-views), but it's not something I'd look into until I was already more familiar with dbt.",7

So I was able to pull data from my redshift database with the first `my_first_dbt_model.sql`. It returns a list of user_ids.

This sounds like you tried to use the `user_id`s directly in a next query, something like this 

```sql
--This won't work
select * 
from {{ source('schema', 'table') }}
where user_id in ({{ ref('my_first_dbt_model') }}
```

Am I understanding you correctly? If so, that won't work - `ref` returns the full table name, not the list of data it contains.

If not, can you please post the full code of `my_first_dbt_model.sql` and whatever second model you were writing when you got the error message? You can post code by typing three backticks (```) at the start and end of a code block.",9
4999,"dbt-cloud-cannot-reference-to-first-data-model","`my_first_dbt_model.sql`:

`my_second_dbt_model.sql`:
```
select *
from {{ ref('my_first_dbt_model') }}
where user_id = 1
```
So I think my understanding of what `{{ ref('my_first_dbt_model') }}` is wrong. Because I did think it would return the output of the query from the first model. If it is simply returning the `name` of the first dbt model, which isn't a materialized view in redshift, that explains why the second query failed because it doesn't exist in my database.

So I'm a little confused as to how to use dbt models and build materialized views.
My objective is using dbt to create intermediate tables that are easier to query than using a long and complex query to pull data directly.

Thank you so much for your help thus far!",10
4999,"dbt-cloud-cannot-reference-to-first-data-model","Those two queries are correctly written (the first one should really use a [source](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources) to reference `public.pages`, but we can set that aside for a moment). 

When you invoke `dbt run`, it should compile the `ref`s into actual table names and run code along the lines of 

```
create table something.something.my_first_dbt_model as (
  select distinct user_id 
  from public.pages
)
```
and 
```
create or replace view something.something.my_second_dbt_model as (
  select *   
  from something.something.my_first_dbt_model

You'll see that the second one doesn't return the _output_ of the first query per se (i.e. it's not returning an array of `[1, 2, 3, 4, ... 99999]`), just the name of the first model. This does let you build intermediate tables that are easier to query, so you're on the right track conceptually.

Have you gone through the [getting started tutorial](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/getting-started)?

You can't comment out a Jinja command with a SQL `--` comment. See this:

```sql

It is a bit confusing that there's two comment styles, but it's because there's actually two languages in use. 

FWIW, if you did 
```sql
/*
select col1

```

then you'd be OK as long as the ref resolved. If the model doesn't exist then you will get an error. 

Compare these two:

Each time dbt jobs are rerun on dbt Cloud, project documentation is updated. However, to access that documentation, you have to go each time via login page. It is because on each dbt job run documentation URL changes with different run ID.

It would be nice to have permanent URL which always points to the latest version of project documentation in dbt cloud. This would allow to permanently link to model documentation from outside sources, like wiki pages, intranet resources.
Good example is GitHub URL to download latest software release. Internally its a new commit, but that latest version is accessible via permanent URL:

2. A job-specific link, like this: `https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs`

How many threads do you have in your job definition? You said AWS spend so I assume you're using Redshift. Too many threads in Redshift can lead to resource contention and the job actually running *slower*. I would aim for 4 (maybe try with up to 8 and see where you get a decreasing return). 

You might be able to create a single job that contains several steps, something like this: 
```
dbt build -s +big_job --exclude big_job --threads 4
dbt build -s big_job --threads 1
dbt build -s big_job+ --exclude big_job --threads 4
```

The one thing to keep in mind here is that any nodes that aren't related to `big_job` won't be built using this selector. If that's a problem, you might be able to express it with a [YAML selector](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/yaml-selectors) but I haven't spent enough time using those to have any useful guidance.",4

5019,"dynamically-create-models-using-schema-files","OK that makes sense! The first problem you're going to have is that dbt runs inside your warehouse, and can only do things that you could do in straight SQL. 

Which warehouse are you using? You're going to need some sort of function that can ingest the file from S3 and make it available in SQL. Perhaps a UDF that returns a string of json?

If you can do that, then you should be able to parse a json blob relatively easily and create a model using jinja templating. You'd need to make a file for each model you want to generate. 

Once you've done that, you will still have the problem that you won't be able to automatically attach tests to the models because yaml files can't be dynamically generated. 

Honestly if you only have 10 files then it sounds like a lot more effort than it's worth for it to be 100% dynamic. How often do they change that the additional functionality is worth the overhead in complexity?

If you really want to go down this path though, an alternative approach might be to template the sql and yaml files in Python and then run dbt as normal on the results of that work.",4

• If each customer needs their own set of tables (`customer_1/person.sql`, `customer_2/person.sql`...), you'd want some sort of codegen tool to make the template files that each reference a macro. Up to you whether you dynamically generate those from scratch at the start of each run, or just re-trigger them when you get a new customer or their schema changes. This can't be done directly in dbt.
• If your requirements allow a single table with each customer's data unioned together (`person.sql`, `'address.sql`...), you could check out <https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/unioning-identically-structured-data-sources/921/1>

If you used `dbt run`, then it will create the models without testing them. If you used `dbt build`, it will create the models and then test them, and if they fail they will prevent downstream models from being built. 

Running tests against the temp model and only committing if they pass is an interesting idea; I suspect the answer to your question is that the majority of dbt's models are views instead of tables so don't go through this interstitial state. 

As noted above, `dbt build` will stop downstream models from being built if the test fails, but that still means that the failing model is in prod.

For what concerns option 1: what is your suggested approach to temporarily archive a schema we'd like to keep for disaster recovery as we test for Blue / Green Deployment?

I couldn't find a post specifically on this topic so far.",1
5051,"how-do-i-temporarily-make-an-archive-copy-of-a-schema","A couple of options:
1. You could temporarily [set a custom schema](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas), configure everything to [build as tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/materializations#table) and then do a standard dbt run. You would wind up with a copy of every model in a separate schema
2. You could do something with jinja, e.g. use [`dbt_utils.get_relations_by_pattern`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/tree/utils-v1#get_relations_by_pattern-source) and then loop over its results with handwritten sql statements: 
```sql
--pseudocode
{% set relations = dbt_utils.get_relations_by_pattern(schema_pattern='original_schema', table_pattern='%') %}

{% for relation in relations %}
  create table original_schema_archive.{{ relation.identifier }} as (select * from {{ relation }})

dbt core:1.2
dwh: Bigquery
Model type: Incremental

 The access is not getting revoked via DBT.Below are the steps which i have followed and could see issue in the dbt.

**case one:**
I have applied the grants as below so that user someone can access the table.

{%if target.name =='dev'%}
   {{ config(grants = {'roles/bigquery.dataViewer': ['user:someone@yourcompany.com']}) }}
{%endif%}

**result**

 user (someone@yourcompany.com) is able to access the table. I can see grant statement in the log

table to check metadata of roles/principles.
.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.OBJECT_PRIVILEGES
    where object_schema = ""dataset_name""
      and object_name = ""table_name""

**Case two**

Now i need to revoke access to user :someone@yourcompany.com and provide access to user :sometwo@yourcompany.com. I have updated the code in model as below.

{%if target.name =='dev'%}
   {{ config(grants = {'roles/bigquery.dataViewer': ['user:sometwo@yourcompany.com']}) }}
{%endif%}

**result**
after dbt run the revoke got  triggered for someone@yourcompany.com and grants got triggered someone@yourcompany.com. The user:someone is unable to access the table and user:sometwo is able to access the table. I can see the revoke and grants statements in log.

**use case three**
I need to revoke access to the user sometwo@yourcompany.com and as per dbt documentation (https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/configuring-grants) I have left it blank as below in the model.


{%if target.name =='dev'%}
   {{ config(grants = {'roles/bigquery.dataViewer':  **[]**}) }}
{%endif%}


**Result**
 **user sometwo@yourcompany.com is still able to access the tables.** Also i can't find revoke is getting triggered in logs. 

**Expectation:** The dbt should trigger revoke to remove access to user:sometwo@yourcompany.com 

When i ran below query(taken from log) i **can't** find the same.
 **select privilege_type, grantee    from `gcp-project`.`region-EU`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.OBJECT_PRIVILEGES**
**where object_schema = ""dataset_name"" and object_name = ""table_name""**
**-- filter out current user**
**and split(grantee, ':')[offset(1)] != session_user()**

I have changed the query as below and i could find the entry in metadata table.

**select privilege_type, grantee from `gcp-project`.`region-EU`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.OBJECT_PRIVILEGES where object_schema = ""dataset_name"" and object_name = ""table_name""**

There are [strategy-specific configs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models#strategy-specific-configs) available when configuring incremental models, and one of them is `merge_update_columns` if you use the `merge` strategy on adapters which support it (including Snowflake, BigQuery, Apache Spark, and Databricks). I wonder whether passing an empty list to that would mean nothing would be updated if the key already exists?

In general, cursors and stored procedures are not part of the dbt mindset. In general you should try to work out how to express your models as simple select statements that describe the way you want your data to be at the end, not worry about how exactly it gets there. 

As an example, we have a [blog post about migrating stored procedures](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/migrating-from-stored-procs) - what was originally an enormous block of code with upsert logic backed in turns into a handful of tightly defined modules which are unioned together. This isn't a 1:1 mapping with cursors but it has the same thought pattern.

I was playing around with models and I have a question about data refactoring. I work in a company that deals with customers that have different languages, and depending on that language I wan't to update my query followingly.

As instance I have a column called **state** that either container the string `accepted` or `not accepted` values by default, but I want to change them to `accepté`  and `non accepté` if the customer is french.

I was wondering what was the best practice to do so. I was thinking of using a variable that specifies the customer's language, but I wonder how to switch values in the query smoothly.

A first approach would be to have a if/else condition but if I would like to add more languages in the future (which will surely happen), I fear it would became a mess like this
`{% if var('language') == 'en' %} 'accepted' {% elif var('language') == 'fr' %} 'accepté' {% elif ... %} 'akzeptiert' ... { % endif %}.`

What I was thinking of was to read value from an external YAML file, the way we can use the directive `doc` to load markdown files for documentation.
The final result would look like :
`{{ yaml('my_yaml_file')['state'][var('language')] }}` which is much better.

dbt is normally used for analytics workloads, where instead of changing the display text you would be normalising it by flattening the status down to a single `state_id` column or something. 

From your description, it's unclear to me whether you're changing the display for inclusion in rollup reports to stakeholders from multiple languages, or planning to use this to control the UI that's shown to end users.

In general, the dbt mindset encourages you to move away from thinking about inserting data, then updating other data and dropping a temp table at the end. Instead, try to think of it as writing a select statement that describes the way your table should look at the end, regardless of how it gets there. 

By default, dbt will drop and re-create a table during each `dbt run`, which might feel counterintuitive but dramatically reduces the amount of mental overhead you have to deal with while building models. At the point that this becomes a performance problem, you can look at creating incremental models, but even then you will still describe your model in terms of a `select` statement and just provide a bit of extra metadata around which rows to delete/insert/update.

If we were doing a normal materialized table it doesn't matter if both sources get updated as we will recreate the entire table each run.

But can we convert the above transform to incremental if both `customer_orders` and  ` jaffle_shop.customers` are incremental? I.e, changes in both `customer_orders` and `jaffle_shop.customers` should be reflected in the final table.

The issue is that the above query converted to incremental will only cover changes from `jaffle_shop.customers`.

The only way I can see pushing both sources as incremental is to write two queries and then do a union. Is there a better way to do implementing this scenario with dbt? Even with the union it's not simple as we will need to clear duplicates before dbt can execute incremental updates and this becomes really complex as the number of sources increases.",1

Thanks a lot for the reply.

I understand now why the materialization type won't matter with dbt as it's doing the transformations with all the data and applying a filter on top of the result and then pushing to the sink(At least in this case).

[/quote]

When you say sources here, I'm not sure if you mean `source` in the way dbt refers to it ([a raw, totally untransformed table which isn't controlled by dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources)). If you do, then no there's no way to move incremental filters into the source table, because dbt doesn't control that table, it just reads from it.  

You can make your initial staging (bronze or silver) models which read from and tidy those sources incremental if you want to, but keep in mind that each model is standalone, there's not a way to push logic into one model from another.

As a heads up, we strongly recommend holding off from making models incremental until the performance demands it. Although incrementals can improve warehouse performance, that comes at the cost of more complex model logic and a more brittle project whose tables are harder to modify as you develop. 

In general, we prefer to optimise for humans' brains!",6

Yep! Reliably getting just the modified data, across all your models, is very fiddly. 

A way that dbt can help to reduce the complexity is to handle all of your dependencies etc automatically, so you can break your code up into small modular pieces but be confident that they'll be built in the right order (to say nothing of automatic quality testing, documentation, etc) 

The good news is that if you build everything as views at first, you can change some of the slow ones to tables with a single line of config later, instead of having to rewrite lots of DDL.

Produces this Warning: 

`the `surrogate_key` macro now takes a single list argument instead of multiple string arguments. Support for multiple string arguments will be deprecated in a future release of dbt-utils. The dbt_.foo_bar model triggered this warning.`

The warning makes a lot of sense to me.  But I'm having trouble fixing it... 

Adding square brackets like this: `{{ dbt_utils.surrogate_key(dbt_utils.get_filtered_columns_in_relation([ source('source',  'table'))]) }}`
produces SQL which is not what I'd expect.
By that I mean:
instead of `md5(cast(coalesce(cast(field1 as TEXT), '') || '-' || coalesce(cast(field2 as TEXT), '') as TEXT))`
I'm getting `md5(cast(coalesce(cast(['field1', 'field2'])))`

More detailed example:

print get_filtered_columns_in_relation to see what it looks like:

```
{% set column_list = dbt_utils.get_filtered_columns_in_relation( source('source',  'table')) %}

-- print the column list to see what it looks like
{{column_list}}
-- it prints something that looks like a list, surrounded in square brackets. example ['field1','field2']

--  manually add some square brackets as another test
{% set column_list2 = [dbt_utils.get_filtered_columns_in_relation( source('source',  'table'))] %}

-- print the column list 2 to see what it looks like
{{column_list2}}
-- it prints something that looks like a list, with one list in it.  example [['field1','field2']]
```

Try to use it in SQL

```
with example as
(
select *,
{{ dbt_utils.surrogate_key(column_list) }},
-- the above line produces the new warning
{{ dbt_utils.surrogate_key(column_list2) }}
-- the above produces the strange sql which does not coalesce nulls, etc

I just looked back at my old projects where I *thought* I was was doing this, but I was doing something slightly different.  I was actually looping over `adapter.get_columns_in_relation` and passing in a custom list of that result.  So in fact I have not done **exactly** this before.

This depends on the specific optimisations of the warehouse, but it should be able to push the filter into the view instead of processing the whole query and then throwing away the unwanted data.

No, it's only available inside of incremental models. But, as discussed above if you use the is_incremental macro inside of an incremental model to filter the results of a view, the optimiser should take that into account.

Only if performance demands it - I try to leave everything as views until that gets slow, and then strategically change some things to be tables to speed them up.

I have built a custom macro (post-hook) for incremental models that does the following if `dbt run -m <incremental_parent>+`:
1. Check the checksum  of the` <incremental_parent>` .
2. If the checksum  of the model has changed, drop all of the children of that model that are also built incrementally.
3. Because the `incrementally` built `children` have been dropped, running `dbt run -m <incremental_parent>+` should result in the children being built from scratch - since they should now not exist in dbt.

I was able to get 1. and 2. working but I end up with a database error for the third point, where the thread that builds out the children doesn't seem to identify that the child has been dropped.
I'm not sure why this is happened as if I run the command `dbt run -m <incremental_parent>+`  again (after the first time which produces the error), the children do indeed get built from scratch.

I'm pretty sure that during its setup/compilation phase, dbt goes through and finds all the models it's going to need to build, checks if they exist and generates the appropriate sql. 

Because you are dropping the downstream models in a post hook, dbt is expecting to find them and then panics when it can't. 

I don't think this is a threading error, but you could conclusively prove that by doing `dbt run ... --threads 1`. If that succeeds (I don't think it will), then I would open a bug on GitHub. 

Instead I think you'd need to do this as two separate dbt invocations - firstly build the new one and drop the downstream children, and then a second job which will rebuild the children. 

Another option could be to override the `should_full_refresh()` macro, which has the final say on whether a model should be dropped and rebuilt or not. Not 100% sure if that'll work, but it feels more dbtonic than manually dropping things!",2

We would like to implement a post hook that invokes a dbt pipeline via the API when a new table is added to a specific folder. The question is how to best pass the name of this table to the pipeline. If invoking the command manually, the command line would look something like this:

dbt run --select +mart/destination --vars 'new_tablename: <new_tablename>'

The API doesn't (as far as I can tell from the docs) allow injecting vars or env_vars as part of the JSON body to the API. Is there an accepted trick to doing that, or is it considered a better practice to inject the entire command line using the ""steps override"" field of the body. To my mind, having to inject the entire command line is a code smell because the calling program should only have to provide information (the parameter) rather than implementation (the command line, which would otherwise be stored only within dbt cloud). However, I see no other way to do it. Am I missing something?

I am running Cloud DBT  (version 1.3) with PG14 and trying to understand how DBT handles table materialization without any down time. The introduction of grant support in the configuration with version 1.2 has gotten ride of any permission issues that happened during the life of a job due to hooks. 
Furthermore, as mentioned in several threads, DBT materializes tables in such a way that the original table is accessible while running the computation and is swapped with the temporary file once it has been written.

From these two I would assume that I should be able to access my tables at all time, even when the hourly job is running. However, in practice whenever I run a job the associated tables become inaccessible.

It seems I have either misunderstood how DBT handles this process or I am unaware of an interaction that I might be causing.

I've a rather huge source table which is partitioned by a column ""loaded_at"". I have an incremental model which reads from this source table.
To exclude source table partitions to read, I could make use of the _dbt_max_partitions scripting variable -  something like below
```
  {% if is_incremental() %}
    where loaded_at>= coalesce(_dbt_max_partition, '2022-01-01')
  {% else %}
```
But, the problem is, that in my incremental model I do not partition by ""loaded_at"" but by a different column (due to use-case demands). So _dbt_max_partition would not help here, as it would simply return the maximum partition value of the model (which I can't use as filter for the source table). 

In ""native"" BigQuery I would simply use a scripting variable as follows

```
declare max_source_partition timestamp;
set max_source_partition = (select max(loaded_at) as ts from `my_model_table`);
select * from `my_source_table` where loaded_at > max_source_partition
```
How can one implement such a scenario with dbt? Is there a way to create scripting variables as part of my models? Or do I need to add it as a on-start-hook? Or any better strategies to exclude partitions in my source without having the same column as partition field in my model?

Our Snowflake environment is structured such that we have three environments for our development lifecycle: Dev, Integration and Production, but we _also_ have another facet to our environment which is ""consumer"" and ""core"" data. We intend to maintain consumer (i.e. customer) data in a separate database and schema structure to minimize unauthorized access. So effectively we have 6 Snowflake databases: DEV/INT/PROD x CONSUMER/CORE. 

Would it be a better practice in DBT to have 6 targets in the profiles.yml file, or to override any of the database/schema information at the model level? At this point I'm thinking we have consumer and core as subdirectories of our model folder in our project.

create temporary table example

select

With tests, documentation and design being driven by these files I've mostly wondered is there any advantage to having the entirety of the model set within one file in that directory as opposed to creating one schema.yml file for each model.  Such that you could have dim_date.yml, dim_customer.yml, and so on with the corresponding information within each file.

I know that dbt supports this methodology but I'm not sure if there are any hidden gotchas on implementing one way or another.  

Any thoughts or insight would be beneficial.",1
5240,"advantages-of-one-monolithic-schema-yml-file-vs-multiple","At my previous job we migrated from a single file per directory to a single file per model. I think one file per directory is currently considered [best practice](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview).

The big pros are marginally easier auto-generation of the .yml files, a built-in naming convention (use the model name!), and less Ctrl-F to edit super long .yml files.

The cons are that you can't use [YAML anchors](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/yaml-anchors/) across files, and that you'll probably want to nest all of your yml files into a sub-folder, instead of interleaving them with the model files.

All in all, it doesn't make much of a difference.

It is really easy to write a Python script to do this for you. You can read each big file into memory with `pyyaml` and then dump each model out to its own file. IIRC the annoying part is that it takes some fiddling with a custom Dumper to print out folded scalars (multiline strings) nicely.",2

In the process of teaching myself dbt. Have run into a bit of a snag trying to iterate over a result set from a seed table. Seed table CSV is pretty basic here, just trying to prove the concept

The example code I'm following for this approach is taken from the dbt documentation on 
using run_query(..) jinja function

|1|New York||
| --- | --- | --- |
|2|Florida||
|3|Oregon||
|4|New Mexico||

{% set results = run_query('select * from my_seed_query') %}
{% if execute  %}
{% set results_sv_list = results.columns[1].values() %}
{% else %}
{% set results_sv_list = [] %}
{% endif %} 
{% for item in results_sv_list %}
 {{ print(item) }} 
{% endfor  %}
```

I've tried some variation on this

```
with my_seed_query as (
 select * from {{ ref('my_seed_table') }}
)

{% set results = run_query('select * from my_seed_query') %}
{% if execute  %}
{% set results_sv_list = results.columns[1].values() %}
{% else %}
{% set results_sv_list = [] %}
{% endif %}
{% for item in results_sv_list %}
    {{ print(item) }}
{% endfor  %}
```

and also

```
{% set my_seed_query %}
 select * from {{ ref('my_seed_table') }}
{% endset %}
{% set results = run_query(my_seed_query) %}
{% if execute  %}
{% set results_sv_list = results.columns[1].values() %}
{% else %}
{% set results_sv_list = [] %}
{% endif %}
{% for item in results_sv_list %}
    {{ print(item) }}
{% endfor  %}
```

All of the above produce various errors

However, the code below works as expected and returns a result table, so the seed table is being resolved with ref(...) command, at least in the scenario below

 select * from {{ ref('my_seed_table') }}
)

It's very strange that you're seeing errors about a cycle, when you only have a single model. Normally you'd need multiple models to have a loop between them, *and* you'd need to be using source/ref to define those connections. As @obar1 said you should definitely use `source()` to access your table instead of hardcoding it in! That's how dbt knows what order to build models in and can create the documentation site. 

I'm on mobile right now so can't test it, but I even wonder whether maybe dbt misbehaves if there are no references defined anywhere in the project? Would be a bit weird if it did, but I can't think of another cause offhand.

As soon as I navigate back to Deploy > Run History and run the full job, I immediately get this error shown in the screenshot below. It tells me there a syntax error line1 position27 unexpected'<EOF>', however it does not specify a file name.
I tried to change the order that my models were run in, but the same error persists.
 I'm kind of at a loss as to why I can manually run jobs from the Develop UI, but they fail from the Run History UI.

5281,"failed-job-execution","It's strange that it doesn't tell you which file is impacted! `<EOF>` stands for end of file. My guess is that you have a jinja tag which is not being closed correctly and the parser is getting to the end of the file without finding the close tag. Eg maybe you have `{{ my_macro() }` with only one closing `}` or `{% set something = 123 }` without a `%`. 

If you message the dbt cloud support team using the chat bubble in-app, they might be able to have a look at some logs and see if they can see exactly which file is misbehaving. If nothing else, it'd be worthwhile them knowing that there seems to be a bug where the file name isn't being shown in the logs!

We have recently updated from `dbt-snowflake` version `1.0.0` to `1.3.0` and noticed that the `*_dbt_tmp` step for each DBT model is now being created from a snowflake view instead of a snowflake temporary table as it was before with `1.0.0`:

1.0.0
```
create or replace temporary table {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{DBT_MODEL_NAME}__dbt_tmp ...
```

1.3.0
```
create or replace view {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{DBT_MODEL_NAME}__dbt_tmp ...
```

I would like to know how I can still maintain the initial behaviour in `1.0.0` (DBT models from temporary tables) while still using `1.3.0`. Is there perhaps a configuration that can be changed to keep this behaviour?

We are using the `incremental` materialization for our DBT models, to transform from one snowflake table to another snowflake table.

5306,"how-to-handle-incremental-changes-in-data-valut-model-bigquery-tables","Hi All,

Looking for some approach on how to handle incremental changes in data vault model using dbt or dbt vault?  I have created data vault using dbt vault package. 
 We have created following  layers in our data model.

source  | schema layer | data vault 

Source is sending json messages and we are flattening those json messages and storing in the schema layer and after that we have created data vault model(hubs, sats, and links) from schema layer.
In case of  incremental changes, source is sending only updated columns (not full record), in this case how to handle incremental changes in data vault model?. 
As you know satellite tables stores history information, every time I should retrieve latest record and apply updates on top o fit.
Is there anyway to handle this easily in dbt? or dbt vault?.

Ex -
source sends ;
initial load - 
----------------
in the source
 custid        | name | age| salary|modified date
        123      | abc      | 24  |50000|2022/8/11 00:00:32

in Schema layer:
----------------------
 custid | name | age| salary|timestamp
 123      | abc      | 24  |50000|2022/8/11 00:00:32

data vault - satellite table:
----------------------------------
 custid | name | age| salary
 123      | abc      | 24  |50000|2022/8/11 00:00:32

Now lets assume source sends incremental changes:

incremental change: [only ID and updated column 'Salary']
source:
 custid    |  salary
        123   |60000

in Schema layer:
----------------------
 custid | name | age| salary|timestamp | changeflag
 123      | abc      | 24  |50000|2022/8/11 00:00:32 | I
 123      | abc      | 24  |60000|2022/9/11 10:20:32 |U      [We have to get latest record from satellite tables and update the record with update columns only] 

data vault - satellite table:
----------------------------------
 custid | name | age| salary |changeflag
 123      | abc      | 24  |50000|2022/8/11 00:00:32 | I
 123      | abc      | 24  |60000|2022/9/11 10:20:32 |U

If you don't want that column to be included in your snapshot, you could exclude it from the select statement, or cast it as an array instead of a single string.

I have read that snapshotting source data is best practise, but we are planning on snapshotting our dimension tables once we have modelled the data.

Should we do both? Is the source snapshot just used as a fail-safe to roll back to any point in time if anything goes seriously wrong? Or is there any additional advantages of doing this?

Thanks!",1
5378,"snapshotting-source-and-dimension-tables","@ShaunLF, I actually think one is fine, except if you are performing serious upstream changes on your source tables to arrive at your dimension..
If Yes. Then it's logically efficient to stick to your dimensions when they are SCD's.
Yes it can serve for fail over, but I assume your source tables might have landed from a process that can be regenerated.
Its a two way thing depending on what works for your use case.
I won't want to create snapshots and pay for extra storage on sources if I can regenerate them from a data lake layer on cases of failures. That's why dimension snapshoting will be better to track changes over time.",2

The use case for snapshotting your source data is described here: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots#what-are-snapshots

Also check out the best practices detailed further down on the same page: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots#snapshot-query-best-practices

The reason to avoid snapshotting your final dimension tables is that if you find a bug and need to change your modelling code, you can find yourself with inaccurate results and no way of recalculating the correct data. By contrast, if you snapshot the source data and build on top of that, you can always recalculate everything from first principles if/when you need to. 

I certainly snapshot some final dimensional tables when the additional effort to make the table fully independent of time (or I can't be bothered 🙈), but it's pretty much always in addition to snapshotting the source table instead of a replacement.",4

Another consideration might be to change how you're treating your sources. If you have a use case like this, you could union your sources into a single model and then run the downstream analysis only once: [Unioning identically-structured data sources](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/unioning-identically-structured-data-sources/921)",5
5411,"check-recency-source-for-model-in-dbt-cloud","Hi,

I tried to use [recency from dbt-utils](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#recency-source) to check if data is coming as expected to source tables. For example I want to see if there is data at all in source tables for (-70 minutes from now).
But whatever parameters I use in my source.yml I always get PASS for tests done. 

I am using something like this in my sources.yml:


```
models:
  - name: uat_demand_nosales_flatten
    tests:
      - dbt_utils.recency:
          datepart: minutes
          field: tradeHour
          interval: 70
```",1
5411,"check-recency-source-for-model-in-dbt-cloud","One thing that sticks out to me is that your datepart is `minutes` when it should probably be the singular `minute`. I would expect that to throw an error as opposed to silently passing though. 

I would start by looking at the code in the `target` directory, which will include the rendered versions of your queries to see what was actually run against the database. 

If you run that query you can see why no records are being returned and iterate on the query until you find the cause. 

You talked about testing your sources, but your example code refers to models. Keep in mind that if you are testing sources (the original raw tables that dbt uses in its models as opposed to the ones it creates), then there is native source freshness available: https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/freshness",2

5411,"check-recency-source-for-model-in-dbt-cloud","Checking generated `dbt_utils_model_name_n_ef0c3b` in `target` folder for my case and from what I observed I see that `current_timestamp` used in recency is using:

 `select current_timestamp::timestamp_ntz` which gives:
2022-12-01T02:22:07.700000-08:00 if you use `timestamp_tz`.

And in our model we are running refresh by hour like:
` select  trunc(dateadd(hour,-1,SYSDATE()),'HOUR')` which currently gives 
`2022-12-01T09:00:00` and if `timestamp_tz` is used thats:
`2022-12-01T09:00:00-08:00`

I was checking difference between SYSDATE and CURRENT_DATE [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17925834/2119941).  Although this is for Oracle I believe that same apply for Snowflake

Thanks for responding. Let me say, the S3 bucket is just an intermediary.  I push the files to S3 first, but use Ci/CD to pull those files down from S3 onto a deployed webserver.

* I assume that the directory structure is the same on your S3 bucket as when you test locally? (i.e. the catalog file isn’t in an unexpected subdirectory)
     - Correct. All files live in a single folder without any structure.
* Does your S3 bucket have any sort of permissioning/CloudFront signed URL requirements?
     - N/A.  Files are uploaded to S3 but downloaded to the webserver that serves these files.
  * Can you access the catalog file by pasting its URL into the address bar, or accessing it with curl/wget etc?
    - I can.  If I tack catalog.json on the end of the URL, the JSON loads in the browser.
* Have you tried manually generating a manifest, catalog, etc and copying those files onto your S3 bucket and trying to serve them?
  - Curious what you mean by manually? Currently, I'm using Dagster to issue the CLI command **dbt docs generate**.  
* Are there any other errors in your devtools console, e.g. a 404 showing the path it tried to access?
   - No 404s, just the error in the console which reflects the above error message. (503 - Service Unavailable)

I meant doing the entire flow without involving any other tools (Dagster, your CI/CD tool), i.e. 
1. Run `dbt docs generate` locally 
2. Copy the files to the ngnix server 
3. Try loading the files

If that works, then something somewhere in the automated pipeline is misbehaving. If it still fails, then I would point the finger at your ngnix server. 

The fact that you're getting a 503 error does imply that it's an oddity of the webserver - I missed that in your original screenshot and assumed it was going to be a 4XX error. If it's a server issue then I am going to be doubly unable to help sorry!

Appreciate some help on improving upon this and making the model cleaner with lesser lines of code and also making it easier to add on more variations of wildcard matches.

5436,"multiple-case-statements-wildcard-matches","Hey @derrickt! If I'm understanding you correctly, you have have a lot of different types of credit card (Amex, Visa, Mastercard, etc), and lots of different types of bank transfers (Paynow etc), and want to flatten them down to just credit card, bank transfer, etc? 

If so, instead of a case statement you could consider a [seed](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/seeds), a csv file that gets turned into a table in your warehouse. 

If you made something like this: 
![A table with two columns: payment type and payment group|446x250](upload://95YhXylxljm0cCvl1Xbwm7an57X.png)

Then you could do a join against the seed:

```sql
with payment_map as (
  select * from {{ ref('payment_map') }} --use the name of your seed file in the ref
),

payments as (
  select * from {{ ref('payments') }}

final as (
select

  coalesce(payment_map.payment_group, ""Unknown"") as payment_group
from payments
  left outer join payment_map

)

For more info on why this works, check out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1386166/how-to-use-a-like-with-a-join-in-sql 

Also keep in mind that if you have something like `Amex` and `Amex Black` in your seed file, then you will get a fanout because Amex Black will match against both rows. Remember to add a uniqueness test on your finished model!",2

2.  Is there a way to just specify partial model in DBT?

    b. There are many tables in SQL logic with 'select * from table'. I don't care about much on what columns it is. Is it possible for DBT to run without config file for table schema?

5441,"dbt-on-pyspark-cost-and-models","Hi @yzhang, good questions! 
1. I don't know enough about the pricing of pyspark on EMR to be able to answer this question. If you're using EMR then I assume you're embedded into the AWS ecosystem and would be using Redshift, in which case your nodes have a fixed cost per month based on their size. If you do something like Snowflake on AWS, then you're looking at a credit-based system. 
2. 
    - a) You don't have to add *any* columns in your .yml files, unless you want to add documentation, quality tests, etc. Columns that aren't explicitly documented will be inferred in the documentation site by inspecting the information_schema or similar when you run `dbt docs generate`, and will populate an artifact file called `catalog.json`. 
    - b) Yes (see above)

Specifically ,Iam trying to replace the names of the default meta columns and then I end up getting errors when i run the snapshot command on the model for the second time.
The error message i get is :  Snapshot target has (""x"", ""y"", ""z"") but not (""dbt_scd_id"", ""dbt_valid_from"", ""dbt_valid_to"") - is it an unmigrated previous version archive?
Could you help me figure out what the mistake iam doing here ?

[/quote]

This is going to widely vary based on what the business users want to see.  The number of scenarios are limitless.  But I think the best answer is always start with dbt Snapshot and then model from there.

Here are some generalizations....
**Snapshotting Dimensions**:
Start with dbt Snapshot.  Then work with the end users on their requirements.  Do they want to see  the dimension data as of the time of the transaction, or do they always want to see today's version of the dimension?  Then I build a model that solves their requirement.  Usually the business users do not query the dimension table directly.  We join it to a fact table for them and present the BI tool with one wide table and all of the columns.  (The BI Users will not need to know how to use the valid_from / valid_to dates).

**Snapshotting Facts**:
Again start with dbt Snapshot.  We usually have a model after the snapshot to only display the active record so the Business folks don't need to worry about filtering in the BI tool.  Occasionally users will require a ""snapshot trend view"", example, count active rows by day displayed on a bar chart in the BI tool.  In this case we need to create a view to populate the entire data set (active rows) for each calendar date.",2

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

I am wondering if it is possible to reference the model name from the model file config portion in the macro. The source table name is different on the model level, so it make sense to specify it in the config, and write macro using the variable name, so it can be used on all models. However, the format for the model should be as follows: {{ ref('model_name') }}, so when I use the variable it is not adding the quotes, and doesn't compile correctly.
Config:

{%- set target_date_column = config.require('target_date_column') -%}

 {% if is_incremental() %}

In the documentation, notice this sentence that is the key for this (hacky) solution: ""dbt does not check the syntax of the SQL statements.""
When DBT see this incremental_predicates, it adds a AND statement in the ON (merge_condition) and put your additional statement without any further check. This is very useful for our problem because we can then hackily add:
DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE.key = DBT_INTERNAL_DEST.key) OR (FALSE

DBT then compile it to this:
on (

5557,"use-of-bigquery-multi-statement-transaction-in-dbt","Dear all,
I am trying to integrate DBT in a workflow where I have a set of table in big query being continuously updated by a 3rd party tool (insert or update only).
I know that the provider is supposed to guarantee the consistency of the table with respect to some statements, ie. the set of table is always updated with the transaction feature.
Know, I am wondering if I can regularly extract a snapshot of all the tables throughout the use of multi statement transactions in bigquery:
https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/transactions
To me it seems that for a specific set of model (in my case the snapshot models), I could potentially configure  pre/post hook in dbt project like in here: https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/pre-hook-post-hook to use that feature for my usecase.
In my understanding it should be possible to have the pre-hook (ie begin transaction) running before the first model of the directory is executed, and the post hook (end) is ran after the last model of the directory.

My questions are now:
1:  Is my understanding correct, a pre-post hook can be ran only once before and after a set of models ?
2: See the following comment from dbt hook documentation:

> To achieve this, you can use one of the following syntaxes. (Note: You should NOT use this syntax if using a database where dbt does not use transactions by default, including Snowflake, BigQuery, and Spark/Databricks.)

  SELECT 1/0;

EXCEPTION WHEN ERROR THEN
  -- Roll back the transaction inside the exception handler.
  SELECT @@error.message;

Why one couldn't use this syntax with bigquery as bigquery is supposed to support it ?

In the dbt paradigm, it's extremely common to have a stack of views reading from one another, as this enables you to break up your modelling logic into individual steps. Taken to an extreme this results in performance issues, so we [recommend](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator#chained-view-dependencies) limiting the number of views chained together without a table along the way, but otherwise this isn't an antipattern or something you need to worry too much about.",2

Our modelling best practice strongly recommends using a staging layer to ensure that you only directly access sources once (and then build other models on top of the staging layer), but you can query them directly if you want to remove a layer of abstraction. 

If you choose to go down that path, keep in mind that dbt projects pretty much always have views stacked on top of each other. It's not clear to me why it's important to you that the source not be a view on top of a view, when your downstream models are very very likely to be views on top of views anyway.",4
5579,"schema-yml-reading-a-view-as-a-source","I understand that one of DBT mainframe work is stacked views. In the past, we have seen performance issue with nested views. Sometimes phyical tables are the best options. 

The great benefit of views is having business logic can be change quickly with litle impact and quick turnaround for the stackholders and little backfill efforts.",5
5584,"incremental-load-first-run-check-table-exists-contains-rows","I understand on the first run of an incremental model all source rows will be added and a table created if it doesn't exist:

> Incremental models are built as tables in your data warehouse. The first time a model is run, the table is built by transforming *all* rows of source data. On subsequent runs, dbt transforms *only* the rows in your source data that you tell dbt to filter for, inserting them into the target table which is the table that has already been built.

In my case, the source model contains multiple rows per ID:

|ID|Region|Timestamp|
|---|---|---|
|1|X|01/01/2023|
|1|Z|02/01/2023|
|1|A|03/01/2023|

Within my incremental model I'd like to include a single row per ID that's associated with the latest timestamp.  In the example provided above only the following row would appear in the incremental model:
|ID|Region|Timestamp|
|---|---|---|
|1|A|03/01/2023|

Each time I run the incremental model I'd like to:
* Check if the SQL table generated by the incremental model already exists on the database
* For robustness, if the SQL table exists is not empty/contains rows

If the table doesn't exists or the table does not contain any rows the following script would run:

```
SELECT a.*
FROM  {{ref('orders')}}  a
INNER JOIN (SELECT id, MAX(timestamp) AS MAX_timestamp 			
            FROM  {{ref('orders')}} 
			GROUP BY id) AS max_a ON a.id = max_a.id
```

I believe the initial checks above would be common design pattern and was wondering if there are any standard design patterns or set of functions to use?

I found the following thread helpful but would like to ask if others have any alternative suggestions/ best practices?

Any pointers would be much appreciated 👍",1
5584,"incremental-load-first-run-check-table-exists-contains-rows","dbt incremental models are the same as any other model type, in that you don't need to (and shouldn't!) spend any time thinking about whether the table already exists, and minimal time thinking about whether the table is empty or not. 

This manifests as a query that transforms data in the same way whether or not the table exists/contains rows, with the only difference being _how much data is processed_. 

Have you looked into the [`is_incremental()`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models#understanding-the-is_incremental-macro) macro? Basically what you'd do is 

```sql

  select * from {{ ref('orders') }}

  select

    region, 
    timestamp,

  {% if is_incremental() %}
    -- if the table doesn't exist, then every order row will be processed. 
    -- If it does, then only rows that have changed since the last invocation need to be processed.
    where exists (

This test validates that all of the values in a column are present in a supplied list of values. If any values other than those provided in the list are present, then the test will fail.

The accepted_values test supports an optional quote parameter which, by default, will single-quote the list of accepted values in the test query. To test non-strings (like integers or boolean values) explicitly set the quote config to false.

But neither of the following YAML file formats works for us

5622,"do-i-need-to-set-quote-false-for-an-accepted-values-test-on-booleans","If you enclose the `values` in quotes, then they will be treated as strings by the YAML parser. Otherwise they will be inserted into the query as booleans (which will likely still work, it just means that they will be `True` and `False` instead of `true` and `false`. 

For example, this SQL and YAML: 

```sql

select false, 2

5743,"scheduling-dbt-pipelines-using-two-mandatory-tags","I'm trying to find a solution for scheduling and tagging my models. I have two tags e.g. environment and schedule, where environment can take values like staging/production, while schedule can take values like daily/weekly/monthly. I want to only tag the final model of each data pipeline I have, and when I run my dbt command I want the entire pipeline (inlcuding upstream models) to run. However, I only want to run pipelines that are tagged with both an environment and schedule tag. Ultimately I'm looking for a solution for this task in DBT, however, the solution I've trying to get working is bumping into this problem below.

So the command I've being trying to use is `dbt run --select +tag:staging,+tag:daily` and this does work most of the time. However, if I have say pipeline A, and one of my upstream models (model 1) is a final model of another pipeline. Model 1 is tagged with staging and daily, while the final model of pipeline A (model 2) is tagged with production and weekly. To recap, model 1 is an upstream model of model 2.

If I run the following command for a completely separate pipeline B (not sharing any upstream models with pipeline A) `dbt run --select +tag:production,+tag:daily `. I wouldn't expect any of my models from pipeline A to run (since model 1 and 2 would need to have the tags production and daily, and or be part of the upstream models of a model with those tags, and both of these cases are not true), however, model 1 ends up being run because of the way the intersection operator works. E.g. `+tag:production` will pick up model 2 and all it's upstream models therefore picking up model 1, while `+tag:daily` will pick up model 1 because it has the daily tag. And because each intersection group picks up model 1, model 1 will run even though it shouldn't have. To recap, although  `dbt run --select +tag:production,+tag:daily ` works, and runs what I need, it also unintentionally runs a model it shouldn't have.

Basically because of the current order of operations for DBT syntax selection, selection methods, then graph operators, then set operators I get this problem. If say the order was instead selection methods, then set operators, then graph operators this method would work. Is there anyway around this so that I could make this work? If not, does anyone have any ideas for how I could get this to work?

We are trying to generate Code Coverage for SQL code using DBT tool. We need to understand the set up and configuration for dbt tool. So regarding DBT, I have the below queries.

1. Can we use DBT as a Code Coverage Tool ?

If Yes,
2. What kind of Code Coverage Report Formats does DBT generates (Ex: HTML, XML or CSV).

3. Is there any sample repository to generate Code Coverage for SQL using DBT tool.

5797,"running-multiple-sql-statements-from-a-macro-in-a-pre-hook","I want to run multiple sql statements before my main model (due to some idiosyncracies of teradata data warehouse that I'm using). The sql statements I want to run in the pre_hook depend on whether the model is being run incrementally or as a full refresh, so I have written a macro which needs to have access to the result of the `is_incremental` function.  In my examples there are just two statements but the actual number of statements will also depend on this context.

I am aware of several github issues ([2370](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/2370), [4023](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/4023), 3985, 3986, 5413 (I can only hyperlink the first two as i'm a new user) ) where they mention config information such as is_incremental or custom schema get rendered at parse time instead of run time, and the solution seems to be to nest curlies to make sure it gets re-rendered, e.g.:

```
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    pre_hook=""{{ conditional_pre_hook_macro() }}""
) }}
```
However this solution seems to only work for singular string value for the pre_hook argument of config, whereas I need to pass an array of strings as the pre_hook argument. I can't figure out how to get the macro to render properly with the correct result from `is_incremental` being rendered at run time, whilst having the pre_hook argument render as an array, not a string.

Here an example of the macro I am using:
```
{% macro conditional_pre_hook_macro() %}
{% if is_incremental() %}
create multiset volatile table temp as (
    select
    now() as ts,
    'ran incrementally' as status
)
with data and stats
primary index (ts)
on commit preserve rows
;
insert into temp
select
now(),
'foo            '
;
{% else %}
create multiset volatile table temp as (
    select
    now() as ts,
    'fully refreshed  ' as status
)
with data and stats
primary index (ts)
on commit preserve rows
;
insert into temp
select
now(),
'bar            '
;
{% endif %}
{% endmacro %}
```

 And here is an example of the model. I'm using the `split` method to ensure that the result is an array of strings instead of just one string, but it seems to have no effect:
```
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    pre_hook=""{{ conditional_pre_hook_macro() }}"".split(';')
) }}
select 1 as foo
```
Running this gives the following error, because it is trying to run two statements in one go (this is why the pre_hook needs to be an array, not just a single string):
```
[Teradata Database] [Error 3722] Only a COMMIT WORK or null statement is legal after a DDL Statement.
```
I have tried making my macro return an array of strings, but then the pre_hook just gets rendered as a string with an array inside of it, e.g. ```'[""select foo"", ""select bar""]'```, and I can't seem to coerce this back to an actual array.

Is there a trick to this or is what i'm trying to do fundamtentally at odds with how dbt is desgined to work?

My brief understanding (looking at the docs:) ) is that if you define it as exposure, it should not be anymore a model. Here is the YAML file, in the same folder as the exposure. What it was the previous mfhd_clients model (now turned into exposure) it is not defined in any other YAML.

Do you mean how do you query a snapshot table to get a point-in-time result? If so then, 

[quote=""bonnevie, post:5, topic:5926""]
Is it as simple as only selecting rows in the correct valid range?
[/quote]
yes! 

You would do something like 
```sql
select * 
from {{ ref('the_snapshot') }} 
where getdate() between dbt_valid_from and dbt_valid_to
```
, keeping in mind that the current version of a row will have `dbt_valid_to` of null. It's common to coalesce that to a value in the distant future for ease of querying, normally something like `2099-12-31`.

[quote=""bonnevie, post:5, topic:5926""]
And are you at risk of a full refresh with snapshots, or are they always continuously updated?
[/quote]
Snapshots are updated each time you run the `dbt snapshot` command, and will never be dropped by dbt, even with a `full-refresh` command.  It's a good idea to put your snapshots into a different schema to prevent someone from accidentally dropping them, as their data is by definition non-recoverable (without backups), in contrast to most dbt models where as long as you have the source tables you can get back to the starting point.",6

Our architecture is quite standard: 

dbt + spark via thrift server running on AWS EMR, data stored on S3 as parquet files registered in hive catalog.

So far, the main saving opportunity we found was to utilize spot instance rather than running all instances On-demand. But the problem is that from our observation, dbt pipeline rarely use the task instance but most of the work happened on core nodes (where the data node lives). But we don't want to run core nodes with spot lifecycle as the loss of a core node may introduce data loss. And the run time of the pipeline seems to be in negative correlation with the number of core nodes.

Are there any suggestion on how to isolate the root cause of this behavior? Was it simply because the dbt pipeline we are running is mainly talking to HDFS? So the heavy lifting all happens on core nodes? Or thrift server itself doesn't utilize task nodes (this might be a stupid question, cause I don't fully understand how thrift server works, it sounds like a simple JDBC/ODBC, so it shouldn't be different from a normal spark application right?)

Snowflake's suggestion was to break it up into separate queries with 100 union statements each into separate transient tables, then union all the transient tables at the end (while the current query in snowflake has all 3300+ union statements in one query).

What I've done for now is added a macro to replace the `find_schemas_sql` macro we currently use to build our list of schemas to union. The new macro uses the `find_schemas_sql` and loops through all the schemas 100 at a time and unions them into transient tables, then returns a list of transient tables that were created. The model then goes through that list similar to how it does now and unions the transient tables together. 

If there is a way to create more of a dynamic set of models that could be run in parallel that would include the groups of schemas to be unioned, and then one model that unions them all at the end, that would be awesome. Right now my macro that breaks it up is not in parallel. Each union of 100 tables takes about 10 minutes, so the whole process takes about 2 hours.",3

This model is part of a Job that runs a set of models.

The problem is that I don't want to run all the models in the Job. I only want to run the modified model.
Is there any way through the command line (or whatever) to run only one model from the models in the job in production?

I tried 'dbt run --select model_name --target default' but the target name is ignored since it is launched in the development environment.

A lot of companies do use Airflow alongside dbt Cloud, but unless you have other tools in your data transformation process (e.g. an ML process that you need to trigger in a different system after a dbt run completes) it's definitely not mandatory and you'll be well served by using dbt Cloud's built in scheduler to avoid the extra complexity.

You should definitely have individual schemas for each dbt user on your dev server, to avoid two people accidentally clobbering each other's tables. For example I would have a copy of the `customers` model in my own dev environment at `analytics_dev.dbt_jlabes.customers`, and you would have `analytics_dev.dbt_zenb.customers`, which means that I can mess around with the customers table without impacting you.

We are using DataBricks with Unity Catalog and we observe a peculiar issue with the Incremental Materailization. This Materialization is not working as expected, it behaves as table Materialization rather than Append, we tried all the options mentioned as per the documentation https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/spark-configs. can you please check let us know if this a know issue or a config gap I am doing ?

6091,"order-of-execution-macros-vs-pre-hook-for-an-incremental-model","I need some help or guidance in here.

I have an incremental model which creates a temp table as part of a pre_hook statement.
Later it should execute a macro which call a stored procedure. The create temp table is an input parameter of the sp.

My problem is the macro executes before the pre_hook gets executed.

Is there anyway to achieve this?

I will attach the model and the dbt logs.

6098,"how-to-ref-a-table-i-want-to-keep-static-skip-exclude-not-run","Let's say I have a model that `ref()`s models of deprecated tables which will not be modified.

I have other things that depend on this model, and I'd therefore like to be able to `ref()` this model in those models for the dbt docs.

I also want to be able to version control the SQL.

However, I don't ever want this model to run, because it'll always return the same results and is therefore wasteful.

I've looked at analyses, seeds, and snapshots, but it seems like none fit. I've looked at the `enabled` config, but that prevents anything from referencing the model.

I know I can simply use `exclude` in a `dbt run` command, but that requires us to always remember to exclude this one model, and we're running dbt from within Fivetran, so passing custom CLI flags isn't even an option for us.

I've also looked at custom selectors, where we could default to excluding this model. However, unless I'm misunderstanding, those don't seem very useful, given:

> If I run a command that defines its own selection criteria (via --select, --exclude, or --selector), dbt will ignore the default selector and use the flag criteria instead. It will not try to combine the two.

`exclude` gives me exactly what I want in terms of functionality - I just need a way to apply it permanently to that model.

If this just isn't possible, any suggestions that'll accomplish my below objectives would be most appreciated!:
1. Keep it in the repo for documentation (using `ref()`s)
2. Version control the SQL

Have you considered referring to this table as a source table?

Could you leave the disabled model, add the table to your source list, and refer to it as `source(table_name)`?",2
6098,"how-to-ref-a-table-i-want-to-keep-static-skip-exclude-not-run","I was also going to suggest creating a source, but the version control requirement makes it fiddly (you could have a disabled node as well as a source, but it's a bit weird). Perhaps if you wanted to create it as a source, you could move the code to an analysis file?

Alternatively, you could configure it as an incremental model, and put `where 1 = 0` inside of your `is_incremental()` block which would mean it would never change anything.

I was considering doing this, but then I don't think I'd have any data lineage for what's upstream from the table, since it'd be a ""source"". Unless I'm misunderstanding that?

Hmm yeah. This could do it! Probably the best approach now.

6111,"dynamic-models-specific-in-config-tables","Hi all!

Any help you can give on the below would be gratefully received.

We have the following challenge:

- We have many customers for a platform we're building that ingests data using DBT from various sources
- The bulk of the logic in the DBT flow that process this incoming data is the same for all customers
- For some models however, a different approach needs to be configured per customer. Eg. Both customers use a table called ""Accounts"" to hold customer data, but customer A uses a standard field ""Industry"" to hold the customer segment, whilst customer B uses a custom field ""Segment_C"".
- We break the logic for how to capture ""customer_segment"" into two separate models (one for customer A and one for customer B) and then ask DBT to use the correct model when it gets to that part of the flow.
- The ""which is the correct model"" config lives in a table in our data warehouse. We want to have DBT read the configuration for which model to correctly include for customers A and B whilst retaining the rest of the flow identical for both customers

Challenge:
-- DBT won't let us dynamically insert ""--depends on comments"" in models, which breaks our approach

Question:
- Is there a way to add --depends on comments for models in some kind of pre-hook to get around this?
- Is there a better way to deal with dynamic model requirements?

Many thanks!",1
6111,"dynamic-models-specific-in-config-tables","Interesting question! Is the (very cut down) DAG that you're working with something like this? 
![image|690x182](upload://dGiSoz8athhF9IqRzTMxpdW4NIU.png)

If not, can you let me know what it actually looks like? You can use https://mermaid.live to generate a diagram, this is the template I used: 
```
graph LR
    acc1[source_accounts_1] --> ta1(transformed_accounts_1)
    acc2[source_accounts_2] --> ta2(transformed_accounts_2)
    ta1 --> seg(customer_segment)
    ta2 --> seg
```

It's not possible to embed arbitrary `depends_on`s earlier in the flow, as the DAG is generated before any of those things are rendered. 

One idea I just had (pretty sure it'll technically work, but might not be practical for you) would be to put both customer A and B's `depends_on` into each other's files, i.e. 

```sql
--depends_on: {{ ref('transformed_accounts_1') }}
--depends_on: {{ ref('transformed_accounts_2') }}

select * 
from {{ determine_correct_table() }}
where ... 
```

As I've been writing this, I'm realising my example DAG above must be completely wrong, but I'm not sure what it should look like. Hopefully this is a jumping off point for you though; if you can give some more real-world context I can try to be more helpful",2

- it's very uncommon to call a yaml file in the `models` directory `dbt_project.yml`. There should only be a single `dbt_project.yml` file at the root of your project. It's not *illegal* to call your model config files that (they can be whatever you want), but it's very confusing. [Here's how we normally name our files](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview#guide-structure-overview)

```yaml
version: 2 
sources: 
  - name: something
    ... #rest of a source definition here
models: 
#nothing at all here

That is, you have a `models` key which doesn't contain a list - it's probably empty but I guess it could also contain a dictionary or some other structure. Can you post the offending file?",2

This isn't how dbt works - it expects to find a single `dbt_project.yml` file in the root of a project, and it expects that all yaml files it finds in the `models/` directory to be config/property files which look like [this](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/model-properties). This is why it's asking you to set `version: 2` - that is the correct value for a yaml file inside of the models directory.

What are you trying to do that means you want to put multiple `dbt_project.yml` files throughout your directory? Did you know that you can configure behaviour at the directory level from the root of the project? 

For example: 

```yaml
#dbt_project.yml

name: 'dev_project'
version: '1.0.0'
config-version: 2

# This setting configures which ""profile"" dbt uses for this project.
profile: 'default'

Thing is, the whole architecture is set-up in a such a manner that, it loops through each individual directory , parses it as first step of ensuring there are inconsistencies in the model.

In terms of how it's getting used, all the models for given dataset are first copied over to the cloud. We then have a Airflow composer job (given dataset) running a kubernetes pod, which in turn runs the dbt commands for a given job (against the given dataset).",5

So it sounds to me like you actually have dozens of tiny little dbt projects - a dbt project is defined as any directory that contains a `dbt_project.yml` file at its root. If you're iterating through each directory one at a time, then I can see why you would be able to do this.

Does this mean you have also not added any extra `.yml` files? 

Because you have blurred out the original screenshot, I can't see what paths your files are located at. I suspect it's something like this though: 

```shell

6131,"dbt-support-for-schema-versioned-database-objects","Hello - dbt newbie here asking if there is a feature in the platform to help us manage multiple (simultaneous) versions of database objects where schemas change over time.

Initially (v1.0 of data product) we have ""modelX"" with 6 columns.  Let's call it modelX_1.0.

Later, the team adds two more columns, and we want to serialize it into modelX_2.0.

We would want a user in the database or client accessing from BI layer or in code to automatically get the latest version if they try to access the name ""modelX"" directly.  But if they access a specific version (e.g., ""select * from modelX_1.0"" it should go to that appropriate version.

Is there a way to have dbt facilitate this behavior (custom schemas?), or am I looking for a supplemental tool or methodology?  Any help greatly appreciated.",1
6131,"dbt-support-for-schema-versioned-database-objects","I love this question and line of thinking! I've been noodling on a similar thing in the back of my head but haven't written anything down yet. 

Today, dbt doesn't have a model versioning system, but you can use [exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/exposures) to document which models power which dashboards so you know where you'll need to change things.

In the future, I think the dbt Semantic Layer might make this possible. It enables you to use full dbt code (including macros like `ref`) inside of your supported BI tool, notebook, etc. What that would mean is that you could override the built-in `ref` macro, or build a different macro, like this:

```sql
--pseudocode...
{% macro version_aware_ref(model_name, version=None) %}
  {% if version is None %}
    {% do return(ref(model_name)) %}
  {% else %}
    {% do return(ref(model_name_v ~ version)) %}
  {% endif %}
{% endmacro %}
```

You could already do :point_up:  today, but it wouldn't be accessible from your BI layer, only from inside the dbt project. The Semantic Layer is what would unlock the full potential.

We are using the cloud-hosted version of dbt docs and I've been trying to figure out if there's a way to see the user engagement there (mainly, page views) but I can't find anything in the documentation. I'm not sure if this is a feature that doesn't exist yet or one that simply isn't documented.

## The context of why I'm trying to do this

I'm interested in tracking the user engagement (just the **page views** would be more than enough) in dbt docs. That could provide some insight as to what models need more attention in terms of documentation.

## What I've already tried 

I've also searched through the community discussions and through the GitHub repo without much progress. I know there is an [optional user tracking](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs#send-anonymous-usage-stats) that dbt collect on their side.

It's doing several things:

- Running a dbt Cloud job.  The job I have configured will run any modified models and anything downstream.  You can also do something really simple here like `dbt compile --exclude fqn:*`, which will still generate the `manifest.json` file but not actually run any queries.
- Retrieve the `manifest.json` file from the completed run
- Save the `manifest.json` file into a directory in your project.  Once there, you'll now be able to defer to that artifact within the IDE.

Another option is using the [upstream_prod](https://hub.getdbt.com/lewisdavies/upstream_prod/latest/) package.  This package overrides the built-in `ref` function and allows you to select from production objects when appropriate.  No github action or deferral necessary here!

If you're trying to track the results of your dbt invocations, you could also look at the [dbt_artifacts](https://hub.getdbt.com/brooklyn-data/dbt_artifacts/latest/) package, which will deal with a lot of this for you",5

Now I am exploring more about run_results and other artifacts. One thing I would like to explore is tracking the model runs as and when they run. ""on-run-end"" uploads the results only after the run completes. To track the execution as it progresses, I have implemented pre-hooks and make an entry into a different table. 

If the model succeeds, I updated that table's entry with end time. Otherwise, the end time will be null. Using this, we can track if some model is running for longer times.

Is there a better way to accomplish this?",7
6204,"post-hook-when-a-model-fails","I think you mix too many things. You should separate the logic if you want a scalable and easily maintainable solution.
DBT should run the models because of its primary purpose. For monitoring, you should implement something that doesn't depend on the models themselves.
Package `dbt_artifacts` collects dbt run results and stores them for future analysis.  You don't need to analyze DBT on the run for optimizations. If you want to control the duration of the models, you could add a `timeout` parameter to the `profiles.yml` file to fail long-running models after a specific number of seconds.

However, if you want to track DBT  progress, it depends on how you are running DBT. Either you check CLI output, where you can see the model status and how many models are left, or you could run each DBT model as a separate task, for example, in Airflow, and check the status and duration of each task.
Checking CLI output is a manual task, but you could separate monitoring and DBT processes with Airflow

6204,"post-hook-when-a-model-fails","I agree that you should use the artifacts package to understand your models' behaviour as opposed to tracking their behaviour in real time. `post hooks` only run for successful models, whereas `on-run-end` hooks always run.

grant usage on database db_analytics_dev to role wd_test;
grant usage on all schemas in database db_analytics_dev to role wd_test;
grant usage on future schemas in database db_analytics_dev to role wd_test;

Make sure your URL for github uses all forward slashes.

One thing I am not sure of, which may not be a thing, I could not reset the ""environment"" between tests and I don't know how Cloud dbt functions behind the scene so all the success after the first success may have had state that allowed the other forms to pass.

We've got loads of tests on all our models, but running all the tests every time we do a production run has started creating costs. We're in BigQuery. We were considering changing some of our staging models from tables to views, but this would incur even more cost if we're testing several columns in the view.

Perhaps we have too many tests, but they are very useful when developing to check we've not messed something up. (We dev on limited datasets for costs).

Are there nice solutions for setting tests to only run in certain environments? (I know we could tag all the tests so that they are excluded in production - is that the best way?)

Any other tips on how others have covered this?

Why i want to do it?
Some team members need to create dataset, to do so we allow them to contribute to our dbt project.
They perform all of their test in dev and once their happy with their model they open a Pull Request to our repo. They have *read_only* right on my production environment and *create* right on my development environment.
So they build model in development but the data consistency in dev is not always perfect. And as they build complex model, for an easier feedback loop we allow them to build dev table based on production data.

1. You should have a compiled `manifest.json` file. You could place it in an accessible place for your developers.
2. You give BigQuery DataEditor and Bigquery JobUser permissions for your developers in a development project and BigQuery DataViewer permission in a production project.
3. The developers have to set up their `profiles.yml` file configured. `project` key should refer to a development project, `dataset` key to the developer dataset e.g., `dev_alice` (https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/environments#how-do-i-maintain-different-environments-with-dbt)
4. Developer writes or modifies a model and runs the following command:
`dbt run -s model_B --target dev --defer --state folder_path_to_production_manifest`
>Read this article carefully and what the difference gives flag `defer` and `state` (https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/defer)

Simply put, it will create `model_B` in the development project under dataset `dev_alice` using data from `model_A` in the production project.

Furthermore if developer writes another command:
`dbt run -s model_C --target dev --defer --state folder_path_to_production_manifest`
Given that `model_B` already exists in the `dev_alice` dataset, it will refer to this modified model in dev env.

This workflow allows us to go further through the pipeline and implement required code changes without modifying production data and testing if the changes work with other models.

6. When the development part is over, the developer pushes code and creates a pull request.

### Summary

The main point is that in most cases, you should handle the environment using the `target` flag and define the target project and dataset in the `project.yml` file.

Regarding production data, you should use flags `defer` and `state` to dynamically change referred models to production models in case they do not exist in the development dataset.

NOTES:
- you should constantly update compiled `manifest.json` file for the developers to point to the newest version.
- each developer defines their development dataset in the `project.yml` file. It is possible to write a more advanced materialization macro if there is a need to change the dataset based on a Jira task, for example (https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas#why-does-dbt-concatenate-the-custom-schema-to-the-target-schema)

6300,"using-macro-this-and-selected-resources-fail-because-one-is-empty-at-compilation-and-the-other-at-execution","Hi @wefo ,

Thanks for the time you took to give a well structured answer!
I have been working with `--defer` and `--state` previously and the reason why i think this is **not** a solution in my case is because i don't want this behaviour : 
`Given that model_B already exists in the dev_alice dataset, it will refer to this modified model in dev env.`

Let's say i want to build `model_C` in dev. I want that whatever if `model_A` and `model_B` exists in my current environment (dev), i will still be using production data. (because we don't know if `model_A` have been build with production data or dev data or if the data are up to date in dev).
And if i want to build `model_B` then  `model_A` will be pointing to prod env. So there have to be a macro deciding which env to take based on the fact that i'm part of the {{selected_resources}} no?

To renforce the fact that the `--defer`flag is not my solution. This mention in the `--defer` documentation is not ok with what i want to produce =>

> When the `--defer` flag is provided, dbt will resolve `ref` calls differently depending on two criteria:
> 1. Is the referenced node included in the model selection criteria of the current run?
> 2. Does the reference node exist as a database object in the current environment?
> If the answer to both is **no**—a node is not included *and* it does not exist as a database object in the > > current environment—references to it will use the other namespace instead, provided by the state manifest.

Do you see why i think the `--defer` flag is not a solution in my particular case?",11
6300,"using-macro-this-and-selected-resources-fail-because-one-is-empty-at-compilation-and-the-other-at-execution","Yes, I get your situation, but it's very strange anyway.

Have you thought about misalignment? If I add a column to `model_B` and test it in dev, after that, I want to adjust `model_C`, including this column. I have to take into account that the column exists, and I cannot take production data. I should use `model_B,` which I already created. This workflow ensures that there will be no discrepancies between related models when I push all changes to production.

On the other hand,  if you work on entirely different tasks and want to make independent adjustments to `model_B` and `model_C`. And as you mention, in this case `model_B` should take `model_A` from prod and `model_C` from `model_B` in prod.

I have solved this using a custom schema name, and my developers work not on a dedicated dataset (which we could set in the `profiles.yml` file), but they pass an additional argument (Jira task ID) to `dbt run` command. Then we have a defined custom schema generator (https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas#how-does-dbt-generate-a-models-schema-name) which takes that argument, e.g.

`dbt run --select model_B --target dev --vars 'task: JIRA_ID'`
this compiles to
`dev_project.JIRA_ID.model_B`

Obviously, you should remember not to create `model_A` in your dev so `defer` could do the job, otherwise it will not work.

What I like about it is that we could check not only the code during pull request, but also check how the data looks in dev env. Furthermore, the developer could work on different tasks simultaneously without messing with different code changes in the same dataset. After the pull request passes all tests, we delete the associated dataset.",12

1. do that (and just hide those schemas from everyone except the engineers using privileges)

Easy option: Run the dbt commands from Bash Operator to start with.
-If you are on airflow composer then would recommend running dbt over kubernatespodoperator
-not yet ready for production workloads, but you may try this option too.

6321,"leveraging-invocation-args-dict-for-a-query-comment","## The problem I'm having
As per [this recommendation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/query-comment#advanced-use-a-macro-to-generate-a-comment), I am building a macro to use as a custom `query_comment`. I can't seem to leverage the invocation_args_dict in this macro the way I do in other macros. The [compilation context](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/query-comment#compilation-context) does not include invocation_args_dict in its list of accessible variables.

My questions are:

1. Is there a way to include args in the query_comment? Not just command line args, but all args, the way `invocation_args_dict` captures them.
2. Why do query_comment's not allow you to leverage invocation_args_dict at this time?

## The context of why I'm trying to do this
We want better visibility in our Redshift query logs - when we view query text right now, we don't know what job a given model is a part of, which makes QAing a longer process than it should be.

## What I've already tried 
I've tried using `node.invocation_args` instead, but this doesn't supply me the args I need // any args for most invocations.

## Some example code or error messages
This is the macro that I have built that is failing due to invocation_args_dict.
```
{% macro query_comment(node) %}
    {%- set comment_dict = {} -%}
    {%- do comment_dict.update(
        app='dbt',
        dbt_version=dbt_version,
        profile_name=target.get('profile_name'),
        target_name=target.get('target_name'),

## The problem I'm having

I am new to Dbt and working with our data team. We have built our models and we are thinking about how to deploy them to our dev and production warehouse which is running on Snowflake.

We are currently using corn jobs with GitHub action to run the command and update our models.
The issue we are having is when we run a simple `dbt build` command it is taking around 11 minutes to complete.

I am looking for optimal ways of doing this. I don't want the command to hang on GitHub action while the queries are being executed on Snowflake. We are being billed for this on Github.

##  What I am thinking about as a solution

Is there a way to run the command `dbt build` and not wait for the query to complete on Snowflake to finish the job? Then on the data warehouse use a sort of hook that will send a message let's say in a slack channel if there was an error on the queries we are running.

Did someone face a similar problem in his job and what approach did they take to solve it?

I am trying to avoid using debt cloud to run the query because it does not offer the flexibility and customization we want.",1

I would like to rename this table to `daily_events_DATE` without losing any of the data in the table. (Replace the hyphen with underscore)

Big Query's UI doesn't display date-sharded tables correctly if there's a `-` (hyphen) in the table name and only supports `_` (underscore)

## What I've already tried 
Google searching but I'm quite new to DBT and didn't find any straightforward answers to the question. https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/68 seems to suggest renaming will drop the table and all old data will be lost.",1

Hey,
I'm working on orchestration of our dbt-cloud models using airflow. I'd like to make an incremental models updated for specific dates. The only way I've found to make it work is to provide a date as a variable. That works well for local dbt setup, but I don't see a way to make it work in dbt cloud. I don't see how I can supply a variable for a dbt run in the cloud.
The only way I'm currently see that may work is to create new model for each run and hardcode variable in `execute_steps` parameter. But that is an overkill and I don't like that solution.
Do you know another workaround?
Thanks",1
6336,"dbt-is-incorrectly-altering-my-table-structure","dbt is changing the definition of my database tables while this is not required. I can see it is trying to execute an ALTER statement to change the type of a column from VARCHAR(255) to VARCHAR(500), although the maximum length of the source column is 98 characters so this is not even required.

I can see why dbt is doing this, because it creates a temporary view based on the model definition and uses this view to insert the data into a temporary table. This table is created with a `SELECT * INTO` statement, so it leaves the table definition to Azure SQL Server. Then it compares the table definition of this new temporary table to the existing table in the data warehouse (manually created with a DDL) and detects a difference, which dbt thinks it needs to resolve.

I would like to avoid this all together and tell dbt to leave the structure of existing tables alone. The tables have been created with a custom DLL after careful consideration and I know for sure that all source data will fit into these tables. My question is how do I tell dbt to not change the table definitions but just move the data from A to B?

NB: All model materializations are set to ""incremental"", so dbt is not dropping and recreating the entire table every time a model is run.

6346,"testing-source-data-with-user-defined-tests-macros","Hi Everyone,

## The problem I'm having
I'm trying to develop some tests/macros that can be specified in the project models .yml file. But dbt either returns a warning that there's nothing to do or that the selection criteria does not match any nodes.

## The context of why I'm trying to do this
Our source data is the culprit of most of our data issues. Identifying issues there is ideal. Although, our stage tables are just unions of the various source tables; testing their will suffice. But for my knowledge I'd like to know how to test on sources. 

## What I've already tried
I started with the basic built-in tests like `unique` on the models, then applied them to the sources. Running `dbt test` does not work, but that might be expected behavior if the sources are not in the DAG (ie called by `source()`)? Some of the sources are in the DAG while others are not. 

`dbt test --select source:<source>` results in the same issue, and actually `source:*` throws a zsh error. 

So then I tried adding the sources as a model and attempted to test them as such. Same issue as above.

Obviously this does not get to the heart of the issue, that I'm trying to develop my own functions, but using a built-in test is a good starting point. One question related to the real issue: do all dbt tests consider having any rows in the final query a failure? Is there a way to specify a failure using a jinja variable, maybe a boolean?

## Some example code or error messages

```

Looking for suggestions on where to push and save dbt models used for one-time, ad hoc analysis.

## The context of why I'm trying to do this

Using dbt Cloud and Snowflake.

I had to perform a backfill on a database table. To validate, I created a model that executes against a backup of the table before the backfill. I created a second model that executes against the database table after the backfill.

When done, I have two tables that I was able to join and look for errors in the backfill. I used my dbt development schema for my user for the validation.

Now, I have these two dbt models, and related changes to the relevant `.yml` files in a feature branch. 

These models will not run in production. It was a one-time effort.

I don't want to lose the work. Yet, I don't want to put them in the `models` directory with production models. 

## What I've already tried 

I thought about putting them in the `analysis` folder.  There are changes to the `.yml` files in my branch. It'd be ok if I lose the content in the `.yml` files. I could replace the entries in the `.yml` files if needed. There is the issue of having non-production models and artifacts in a repo where the production models are saved.

I also also looked at committing to a repo that is used for ad hoc work. There is not file history in the repo. I'd probably copy-n-paste the models in `.sql` files in the repo used for ad hoc work, and commit them.

I also thought about leaving the models and related changes in a branch in the production repo, unmerged. Let it sit there in the repo until it's obsolete or until it reaches the stale date in a README file in the branch.

6384,"how-to-use-incremental-models-to-detect-regressions-in-historic-metrics","## Background
Imagine that you have expected outputs for a historic metric (total revenue) as described below:
| Year | Total Revenue |
|---|---|
| 2019 | 1 million |
| 2020 | 1.5 million |
| 2021 | 2 million |

How can you test that these historical metrics **do not change** in dbt?

This is an alternative solution to the snapshot-based one proposed [here](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/build-snapshot-based-tests-to-detect-regressions-in-historic-data/1478). 

## Step 1
Let's say that you have a `fct_orders` table, which has one row for each order:
| order_id | order_date | amount |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2019-01-05 | 10 |
| 2 | 2019-02-06 | 50 |
| 3 | 2020-02-07 | 8 |
| ... | ... | ... |

First, you should create a model that sums the amount for each year excluding the current one (for simplicity, we're assuming you have no costs). Let's call this `fct_revenue_summary`:
```
select
        year(order_date) as year,
        sum(amount) as total_revenue
from {{ ref('fct_orders') }}
where year <> year(current_timestamp())
group by 1
```

## Step 2
Next, create an incremental model on top of `fct_revenue_summary` which captures the historical view of revenue outputs. Let's call this `fct_revenue_summary_history`:
```
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental',
        unique_key=['year', 'total_revenue']
    )
}}

select
        year,
        total_revenue
from {{ ref('fct_revenue_summary') }}

{% if is_incremental() %}
where true
{% endif %}
```

## Step 3
Finally, create a test on `fct_revenue_summary_history` to check that each year has a single source of truth for `total_revenue`:
```
version: 2

models:
  - name: fct_revenue_summary_history
    columns:
      - name: year
        tests:
          - unique
```

When you run a `dbt build`, you will get an error if you ever output a _new_ `total_revenue` value for a historic year that differs from the original. For example, if your original `fct_revenue_summary_history` looks like this:
| year | total_revenue |
|---|---|
| 2019 | 1 million |
| 2020 | 1.5 million |
| 2021 | 2 million |

But then, you introduce a breaking change such that dbt now calculates the `total_revenue` for 2019 as 0.8 million, `fct_revenue_summary_history` will now look like this:
| year | total_revenue |
|---|---|
| 2019 | 1 million |
| 2019 | 0.8 million |
| 2020 | 1.5 million |
| 2021 | 2 million |

And the uniqueness test on the year column will fail. 

This allows you to detect regressions in historic metrics!",1

6394,"run-query-before-models-and-use-output-within-models","### What do i want to achive?

Query existing tables to find dates (=partition) filters to be used as date (=partition) filters in dbt models. For filtering i could do joins in each and every dbt model but it turns out to execute slowly. Rather i want to find certain dates first and then substitute those dates as variables in dbt models. 

### How would i like to achive this?

I would like to 
1. run a query before any model exectuion. The query yields a table with a single row like: `date_1: 2020-01-01, date_2: 2020-03-1, date_3: 2020-09-01, date_4= 2020-12-01`. Store this output into variables (best dictionary) and then
2. select those values in a dbt model (e.g. in `where date_column = '{{ fetched_dates['date_1'] }}'` such that after compilation we get hardcoded values in the sql `where date_column = '2020-01-01'`

### What i tried:

I used `on_run_start` in `dbt_project.yml` to execute a macro. The macro uses `run_query` to execute a sql and store its single row output with multiple columns in a dictionary via `set fetched_dates = sql_result.rows[0]`. This seems to work. But when i reference this variable later in a dbt model as in `where date_column = '{{ fetched_dates['date_1'] }}'` it complains with `fetched_dates is undefined. This can happen when calling a macro that does not exist. Check for typos and /or install package dependencies with ""dbt deps""`.

Any advice on how to proceed? Do i have to execute my date fetching query outside from dbt and then pass values to dbt as project variables? Would have much rather relied on logic within dbt itself.",1

We use Domino Data Labs at work and I would like people to use standard environment variables and profiles to connect to the right database and schema.

I saw I can pass the --config-dir to the run command, but I'm trying to make it slightly more seamless for people using the software. Is it possible to set the default location somewhere so dbt run can run without the ""dbt run --profiles-dir /opt/dbt/"" option?

Similarly, can I default to the dev vs prod profile based on which branch of the github account the user is working in? So if they are running code out of the develop branch, it would know this and target the correct dev credentials?",1

I'm trying a new approach for data quality in our warehouse where we would build models on an audit schema and then build again on a prod schema, excluding models that failed the tests during the audit build.

For the 2nd build I tried with the command
`dbt build --exclude 1+result:fail` as mentioned in the doc but I'm getting the following error:
```

`dbt build --exclude 1+result:fail --defer --state ./target` seems to work but I don't really know why and I'm not sure it does the same thing, I still have to wrap my head around the defer method.

Hi,

I'm using dbt on an airflow setup to to create some tables (using models). I have a combination of airflow operators and python code behind that will generate around 10 airflow tasks, each is a bashoperator that execute a dbt run command and each command is about a specific model and each command has it own variables. All the tasks are running concurrently but they sometimes fail randomly with an error that seems to indicates that the partial_parse.msgpack file is unavailable.


The models i have,  uses the same variables (key) but they can have different values from a model to another. 

I'm wondering if this kind of dynamic workflow is a good fit for dbt and what conditions can cause the issue. 
I must mention that i cannot reproduce the issue in local, it only occurs in production ( airflow instance deployed with google cloud platform (GCP)

I recently added a new snapshot, pushed a PR, then decided that I needed to change the `unique_key`.  After adding a new commit, I started getting errors.  That's when I realized that dbt was not building this new snapshot in a separate CI-only schema.

This would also snapshot every table in production on every CI run, which could be fraught with side effects.
2 - I thought about that, but it would start out empty and thus all CI jobs using snapshot models would fail, unless I manually maintained/synced the CI schema.  :thinking: ..... I suppose I could set up a dbt operation to zero-copy-clone my prod snapshots and have that run as part of my prod build job.

I might try this approach..
3 - Honestly, snapshots feel like they were left behind in the run up to 1.0.  I still get annoyed when I have to write them and re-learn that many config.yml options are ignored and I have to put them in a jinja config block.

So let me repeat this back and check I've got it (I've turned this into a Wiki post, so you can edit it directly if I've got anything wrong, then I'll mark it as the solution and use it as the bones of a GH issue)

- By default, dbt snapshots build into a hardcoded schema. [Making the schema dynamic](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/using-dynamic-schemas-for-snapshots/1070) means that every snapshot is considered `state:modified` on every CI run because [in-file environmentally-aware configs trigger false positives](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/state-comparison-caveats#false-positives) and `target_schema` can't be defined in `dbt_project.yml`. 
- You can make a zero-copy clone of the snapshot to a different database at the start of a CI run. `target_database` _can_ be defined using `env_var` jinja in the `snapshots` section of `dbt_project.yml` which means other unchanged snapshots don't get picked up as modified unnecessarily. 
- Cloning to a different database as described in the second bullet and then setting the snapshot database environment variable in your SlimCI job enables snapshots to be Slim CI'd. If you can't do that, you'd need to exclude them from the CI job definition. That is tricky in `dbt  build` context because the `dbt build --resource-type` filter seems to only takes a single resource type anyway, *and* it's not able to be used for exclusion)",8

This isn't true - both `target_schema` and `target_database` can be defined in`dbt_project.yml` along with most snapshot behaviour. It just doesn't work in `whatever.yml` property files (you said this above and I just blanked on it).

And if you're not using an env var to define the location of the model, shouldn’t standard deferral prevent the failures described here:

? I haven't tested how deferral works with snapshots, but I'd be mad to discover it doesn't work the same as any other `ref`.

So I _think_ the main thing to do here is to go and +1 https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/4000, and I'll open a different issue saying that dbt's default schema logic for snapshots is suboptimal, but purely because it creates a bad default experience, not because it makes CI impossible as first believed.

The root issue is that when I set up SlimCI in dbt-cloud, it was not creating CI-specific schemas when a snapshot model was changed and instead ran changed snapshot code in the production schemas.

I put all of my snapshots in a separate database (defined by an environment variable), and I specify the schemas in config blocks (only because I've previously discovered that some options are not honored in a snapshot .yml file).

- dbt only considers creating schemas for models that are actually selected to run ([relevant lines of code](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/6b5e38ee2855e8739414c7f5172b80a2090c3a0c/core/dbt/task/run.py#L431-L432))
- dbt first determines what schemas exist, and will run `create schema ... if not exists` **only if it doesn't think the schema exists.** 

With this in mind, our hypothesis is: 
- the schema does exist (already confirmed)
- The database user that is using dbt doesn't have permission to see the schema _at all_, even that it exists
- One or more of the selected models in your run are intended to land in the `SDNA_US_SDNA_UI_DEV` schema
- dbt can't see that the schema already exists (it's not allowed to!) so it tries to create it, and hits an error. 

I would suggest that you check what permissions the database user has, to ensure it can at least see the schemas. 

From there, if you have a different situation then it would be worth [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues) with the details",7

In general, it's not necessary to try to avoid building seeds etc. The good thing about dbt is that you describe the way you want your project to look, and it makes that happen. Keeping track of whether a seed has changed or not is the sort of mental overhead that dbt wants to save you from, especially for tiny csv files which don't have much compute overhead to reload.

myschema.advertising_data_account1

dbt_utils has a macro called `get_relations_by_pattern` to easily build new Relations for matching tables in your database: [dbt-labs/dbt-utils: get_relations_by_pattern. (github.com)](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#get_relations_by_pattern-source). The name is a little misleading --  you don't use this to get relations that are already defined in the graph, you use it to construct new Relation objects out of tables in your database.

You could use it like this:

```sql
-- models/staging/myschema/stg__advertising_data.sql
{% set source_tables = dbt_utils.get_relations_by_pattern(
    'myschema', 'advertising_data_account%'
) %}
{{ dbt_utils.union_relations(relations=source_tables) }}
```

Then in lieu of your source freshness test, you can create a custom data test that checks for the same thing. The `union_relations` macro adds a column called `_dbt_source_relation` that contains the name of the source table, which is useful here:

```sql
-- tests/test_advertising_data_freshness
select _dbt_source_relation, max(updated_at)

In my organization,  we are using a  *single repo/multiple projects* approach. In some cases, the sources/stating tables have to be duplicated across projects. 

That is usually not a problem. We do have occurences of duplicated model names across projects and it works just fine - {{ ref }} seemed to be project-specific.

However, for one specific project, {{ ref }} seems to scan for models across multiple projects. 

I tried comparing the the dbt_project.yml of the projects for which there is an error vs ones where duplicated model names work fine - but couldn't find any differences.

I know there's a two-argument variant for {{ ref }}, and that schemas can be specified in the model config - but none of that is being used in the projects where things work fine.

Any idea what could be different between the projects, that would explain the different behaviors of {{ ref }}?

You can automate adding the columns in using [dbt_utils.star()](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#star-source) which will mean your views don't fail when columns are added, and also will update without you having to touch the code on your next dbt run.

**All of that said**, my subjective opinion is that staging models are for renaming, casting types, etc.  Essentially creating an endorsed view of your source data.

## The problem I'm having
I want to create a model in a schema related to a customer id -e.g. FOO1_BAR_LND where FOO1 is the customer ID. I also want to pass this customer ID into a column in the view

I have at the moment
`{%set customer='FOO1' %}`
`{{ config(schema=customer+'_BAR_LND') }}`

and this works ok to create the schema  FOO1_BAR_LND and creates the view in there

But when I want to put 'FOO1' into the model itself
` , {{customer}} as FOO_CUSTOMER_BKCC `

the compiler puts 
`, FOO1 as FOO_CUSTOMER_BKCC`

`'FOO1' as FOO_CUSTOMER_BKCC`

I have created a model that I only want to run one time per month (lets say Model Month), but the other models need to run twice a day (lets say Model Day). I want to exclude the first model from the dbt run without using every time the --exclude function. 

This is because we don't want other colleagues to add the --exclude command to every dbt run. So we prefer to have a solution where we can run the 'dbt run' but without Model Month. Ones a month we would like to run the Model Month without changing any settings. 

I tried to set the 'enabled' to false in the config and that works fine. But when I want to run Model Month, it says 'The selection criterion 'Model Month' does not match any nodes'. This is because it is set to enabled false. 

Is there an option to have by default Model Month disabled, but when I want it to run, I don't need to change the settings from enabled false to true?",1
6675,"exclude-model-from-dbt-run-by-default-but-still-want-to-run-the-model-separately","Can you explain more about why you want to skip this most of the time? Your dbt project shouldn't depend on nodes running an exact number of times – or on specific days – for it to be correct; it should be built in an [idempotent](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/idempotent) manner. 

Also keep in mind that when a node is disabled, it also can't be `ref`'d by downstream models, so it would always have to be the final model in your DAG.

[/quote]
Your colleagues should be working in their own development environments, so this should only impact your production jobs which you should be able to set up once and then leave alone for the most part. 

With all that said, you could use a YAML selector and set the [`default` property](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/yaml-selectors#default). This means that when you do a standard `dbt run` or `dbt build` without any other selection commands, it will exclude the monthly model. You would then have a separate job configured which is `dbt run --select monthly_only_model`. 

```yaml
selectors:
  - name: everything_except_the_monthly
    description: ""All nodes except the monthly one""
    default: true
    definition:
      union:
        - method: fqn
          value: ""*""

Have you considered an [incremental model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models)? This is a perfect use case - you can put a check in for new data, something like 

```sql
with upstream as (
  select * from {{ ref('upstream_complex_table') }}
)

select 
  -- complex transformations here... 
from upstream
{% if is_incremental() %}
  where upstream.loaded_at > (select max(this.loaded_at) from {{ this }} as this)

It is possible, but you need to set the `default` property described above. When you do you'll see this output:

BI tools like (Azure) Analysis Services & Power BI perform best when join columns have a small datatype (like int) and memory usage is reduced as much as possible. Importing a pure star schema with hashed values as PK/FK’s in to these tools wouldn’t be the best solution especially not with wide fact tables with many dimension FK’s.

Since last year databricks / delta lake supports auto increment [generated columns](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/08/08/identity-columns-to-generate-surrogate-keys-are-now-available-in-a-lakehouse-near-you.html). 


Is it possible to include this column in the model of a dimension, I did some attempts but weren’t able to succeed. I wonder if there is a way to hook in to the create table statement of the dimension and add a line like:

The goal here is to check, for example, if some rows are missing from the QA version when we know they should be there (because they are in Prod and we know Prod is correct).

So the question is:  when we run `dbt build -s my_table --target qa` , is it possible to reference the version of `my_table` that lives in Prod?  I've tried passing the state from the prod manifest (e.g., `dbt build -s my_table --target qa --defer --state /path/to/prod/manifest`), but upon inspection of the `graph` context var, all values of the `my_table` node point to the QA database/schema, not the prod one.

Am I missing something here? Is it bad practice to do this comparison between QA and Prod in this way?

Thanks!",1

## The problem I'm having
I'm trying to insert records into one data vault hub from multiple models (based on different ERPs each with their own extract/refresh timeline). I know a union all is possible, but that means maintaining the code every time something new is added, making the code more complex. I would rather that I could just have the equivalent of a single insert statement (however that is done in dbt), but dbt doesn't allow multiple models to insert into one table and raises an error on compilation. 

## The context of why I'm trying to do this
I don't know eventually how many ERP data sets I need to bring in

I've used both the scalefree and dbtvault packages.

Oracle databases support this amazing well by supplying a 2nd target table where rows causing exceptions will get inserted, just add LOG <exceptions_table> as part of an Oracle SQL statement like INSERT/SELECT ..LOG myExceptionsTable.

> Blockquote
Question: How to handle the problem of sql exception in a dml statement using dbt

Answer from ChatGPT: DBT (Data Build Tool) is a popular open-source tool for building, testing, and deploying data pipelines. Here are some common ways to handle exceptions in a DBT data pipeline:

- Use the on_error Configuration: The on_error configuration in a DBT model allows you to specify what action should be taken in the event of an error during the execution of a model. The available options are fail, warn, and ignore. For example, if you set on_error: fail, DBT will stop executing the pipeline if an error is encountered during the execution of a model.
- Write Custom Macros: Macros in DBT allow you to encapsulate common logic and reuse it across multiple models. You can write custom macros to handle specific exceptions in your pipeline and ensure that the pipeline continues to run smoothly.
- Use the {% exception %} Template Tag: The {% exception %} template tag allows you to handle exceptions within your DBT templates. For example, you can use the {% exception %} tag to catch any exceptions that occur during the execution of a template and handle them appropriately.
- Logging and Monitoring: DBT has built-in logging capabilities, which allow you to capture any error messages that occur during the execution of a pipeline. You can also use third-party tools to monitor your DBT pipelines and receive notifications in the event of an error.
- Test Your Models: Writing comprehensive tests for your DBT models can help you catch and resolve exceptions before they reach production. DBT includes built-in support for testing and allows you to write tests using SQL or Python.

By following these best practices, you can effectively handle exceptions in your DBT data pipeline and ensure that your pipeline continues to run smoothly.

6802,"carry-forward-attributes-from-an-existing-record-in-destination-model","## The problem I'm having
I have multiple staging models that provide attributes for my destination model/table record. This destination model doesn't exactly fit into a dimension design, but that's another matter.
The situation is that, for the KEY columns in play, not every staging model will have a record.
Key columns = Natural Key + Start Effective Date + System Date

 When building a record joining all staging models, there are going to attributes that are null, if that model does not have a record for the KEY.
However, the ask is that we bring/carry forward the missing attributes from the record having the prior start effective date.

## What I've already tried 
I've explored snapshots, but the destination table is not set up to be a true type 2 dimension and thus having a snapshot between the staging /intermediate models and the final model *might* not work. 
The deviation from a true type 2 in this instance is cause the destination table is designed to hold multiple records for the same natural Key + Start Effective Date + End Effective Date, with the System Date providing the uniqueness on the record.
The End Effective Date however is determined solely by the appearance of a new Start Effective Date value.

## Example
#### Day 1: 

Destination Table data
Natural Key: ABC
Eff Date: 1/1/2023
System Date: 1/2/2023
Stage_1_attrbute: XYZ
Stage_2_attrbute: 123
End Eff Date: NULL

#### Day 2: 

Stage_1 : no records for ABC

Stage_2 record:
Natural Key: ABC
Eff Date: 1/3/2023
System Date: 1/4/2023
Stage_2_attrbute: 456

Intermediate model results using Stage 1 & 2:
Natural Key: ABC
 Eff Date: 1/3/2023
System Date: 1/4/2023
Stage_1_attrbute: NULL
Stage_2_attrbute: 456

Destination Table data (two records now)
Natural Key: ABC
Eff Date: 1/1/2023
System Date: 1/2/2023
Stage_1_attrbute: XYZ
Stage_2_attrbute: 123
End Eff Date: 1/2/2023 -- End date populated.

-- New record
Natural Key: ABC
Eff Date: 1/3/2023
System Date: 1/4/2023
Stage_1_attrbute: XYZ -- Carryforward from prior record
Stage_2_attrbute: 456

Hi @GaneshSubramani,

You can override the default `generate_schema_name` macro

So, instead of using the macro like this

{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name, node) -%}

    {%- set default_schema = target.schema -%}
    {%- if custom_schema_name is none -%}

6831,"unload-data-from-snowflake-to-s3","<!-- https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/legacy/getting-help 
You don't need to keep the headers, but try to hit these points in your question: -->

## The problem I'm having
I created a model that unloads data from Snowflake to S3 and saves the unload times in an incremental model. It works just fine, however, I would like to take it to the next level and make it production-ready. I would be happy to do it using solely the **Snowflake <> dbt** eco-system but I'm not sure how to do it, therefore, I'm seeking some advice. 

## The context of why I'm trying to do this
As mentioned above, the objective is to store incremental records of successful unloads only. 
I already got the model up and running, however, I would like to make it work as an ""atomic unit"", which means, that if any part of the process fails, the entire procedure should halt **without leaving any trace**.
### Here is what I have so far:

```
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    pre_hook = ""copy into @SOME_STAGE/path/ from (select * from {{ ref('my_source_model') }}""
) }}
select max(ts) as unload_ts from {{ ref('my_source_model') }}
where 1=1
    {% if is_incremental() %}
        and ts > (select max(ts) from {{ this }})
    {% endif %}
```
(tz is the timestamp I'm basing the incremental upon and it's the only column I would like to store in my new model)

As you can see, the model unloads data to an S3 bucket using a `pre-hook` that runs a Snowflake `COPY INTO` command.

## The basic scenarios I would like to resolve:
1. Suppose a Snowflake `copy into ` `s3://bucket/path` query is initiated using a `pre-hook`, but it fails. How can I prevent the model incremental build from continuing?
2. Suppose the pre-hook runs a Snowflake `copy into ` `s3://bucket/path` query successfully, but the actual incremental model build fails. How can I prevent the file from being stored in S3? 

## What I've already tried 
I found [this section](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/pre-hook-post-hook#transaction-behavior), but I'm not really sure how to use it for my needs as for example in case 2 (mentioned above) I need to actually clean up the file(s) that the `pre-hook ` wrote to S3.

## To sum-up
I would genuinely appreciate ideas for achieving the objective mentioned above and solving the scenarios I presented. Thank you in advance for your time and expertise.",1
6835,"scalable-yaml-code-generation","Our dbt project has been growing very quickly over the past year, as we migrate many legacy data pipelines from their old form to dbt. Our data architecture involves support for many customers that exist in single-tenant databases, but where the many identically structured canonical data models exist in each customer's database. One of our challenges has been how best to scale out management of the content of our dbt project, especially in terms of managing many yaml files. 

We are turning to greatly expanding out code generation capabilities to help support this. So, for instance, we can have code generation that inspects some metadata that indicates what customers should have what data models/data pipelines, and then generate the corresponding assets (models, seeds, and corresponding yaml) in the corresponding locations in the dbt project. For the generation of yaml in particular, this is a little daunting, and we are hoping that others in the dbt community might be able to share approaches they have taken. Our current approach is simplistic:

* python code gen builds dictionaries in memory, use pyyaml's dump to output to corresponding yaml files
* In some cases, we will read in existing yaml files with pyyaml, append to it, write it back out to the same yaml file

Programmatically building the correct models in python using basic data structures is so far pretty cumbersome. I'm curious if anybody out there has worked on similar code-gen support, and if so, has anybody gone down the path of building out python classes that map to the components of the dbt yaml schemas (similar to what you might do with an ORM), or is aware of any open source projects that aim to facilitate that type of thing. I am thinking we might end up doing something like that, but would love not to re-invent something that might already exist somewhere else.",1

## The problem I'm having
I want to store my tables as managed tables on an external location like adls or blob.
By default databricks stores managed tables in: dbfs:/user/hive/warehouse, it is possible to change this default location by creating the database / schema and definining the location.

Example SQL statement:
CREATE DATABASE test_db LOCATION 'abfss://testdata@storage-account.dfs.core.windows.net/test_db'
or:
CREATE SCHEMA test_db LOCATION 'abfss://testdata@storage-account.dfs.core.windows.net/test_db'

(database / schema are equivalent in databricks)

This way all tables created in this database/schema will be managed tables and the data as well as the metadata will be deleted if a table is dropped. I can't find a way how to add the location to the create schema statement in DBT.

## The context of why I'm trying to do this

How can I add the location to the CREATE DATABASE / SCHEMA statement in DBT in such tables within this database / schema will become managed tables and data is stored on an external storage account?",1

6929,"can-i-create-an-scd-type-2-model-in-dbt-without-using-snapshot","Hi Experts!

I am super new to dbt and have a use case to build an SCD type 2 model which would have valid_to and valid_from (and maybe a active flag) columns. This seems easy to do using a snapshot but I've read that one should not put snapshots on datamart models. 

I'm uncertain why putting a snapshot on a datamart model is a bad idea if we just want to be able to see the history of values that the datamart model had at different points in time?

Can I build a SCD Type 2 model including valid_to and valid_from dates manually in dbt and is there a template I can look at how to do this if it exists?

I've looked through different posts on here but cannot find anything that will give me the valid_to, valid_from columns other than using snapshot. 

I'd like to use snapshot, because it looks very easy and appears to be working but am hesistant due to the warnings suggesting best practice is to only apply this to source tables.

Thank you!",1
6929,"can-i-create-an-scd-type-2-model-in-dbt-without-using-snapshot","Hi @jackiesbauer, I think there is no problem to create a snapshot just to monitor your model if you are aware of the risks.

It is a best practice to use snapshots in sources because from the source you are able to recreate any model at that point in time since you have the raw data and you didn't lose any information through transformations, casting, renaming, etc.

It is not a good practice to use snapshots in models because they are much more mutable than sources, and if you change the way the model is transformed, maybe you can not easily compare current data with historical data.

If you are aware that your snapshot can easily become a mess if you do not take care, I see no problem with using it in your models. It makes no sense to create an SCD type 2 other way since you will have the same problems.",2
6929,"can-i-create-an-scd-type-2-model-in-dbt-without-using-snapshot","Just keep in mind that you
- cannot recreate columns
- depending on the complexity of your model, will not have a reliable updated_at

6930,"as-scalar-isnt-working","Hi @rjames 

`run_query` returns a table, you have to specify the column and row you want.

To do that you can return the column as a list, have a look at this example:

```
{% set payment_methods_query %}
select distinct payment_method from app_data.payments
order by 1
{% endset %}

{% set results = run_query(payment_methods_query) %}

{% if execute %}
{# Return the first column #}
{% set results_list = results.columns[0].values() %}
{% else %}
{% set results_list = [] %}
{% endif %}

select
order_id,
{% for payment_method in results_list %}
sum(case when payment_method = '{{ payment_method }}' then amount end) as {{ payment_method }}_amount,
{% endfor %}
sum(amount) as total_amount
from {{ ref('raw_payments') }}
group by 1
```

source: https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/run_query

But instead of selecting the whole column you can select the first item `results_list[0]`.

Additionally, I have not found the `as_scalar` filter, did you mean `as_number`?

https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/as_number",2
6930,"as-scalar-isnt-working","Thank you @brunoszdl My query returns a scalar value. like max of date. Do i still need to follow these steps. Is there is a way to get the resultset stored directly into a variable as it a scalar resultset?",3
6930,"as-scalar-isnt-working","@rjames , even if your select returns a scalar, the `run_query` **function returns a table**, with one column and one row.

https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/run_query

So, yes, the only way I know is by doing all of these steps, don't know a workaround.

If you want to keep it all **in one line** you try something like

```
{% set your_var = run_query(""select nvl(max(etl_batch_id) + 1, 1000) as etl_batch_id from {{ this }}"").columns[0].values()[0] %}
```
Maybe you have to put it inside a {% if execute() %} condition like
```
{% if execute %}
{% set your_var = run_query(""select nvl(max(etl_batch_id) + 1, 1000) as etl_batch_id from {{ this }}"").columns[0].values()[0] %}
{% endif %}
```
But try without it first.

**I did not test it, so maybe you need to adjust something.**

**I would recommend separating it into multiple lines, so it is easier to debug.**

```
{% set your_query %}
select nvl(max(etl_batch_id) + 1, 1000) as etl_batch_id from {{ this }}

{% set results = run_query(your_query) %}

I had a strange use case with metrics and Lightdash, and wanted to see if others had run into the same problem:

I have a summarised data source, and from it I've create a metric called `metric_one_percentage` (which is just `sum(COL_A)`/ `sum(COL_B)`), and the dimension is ENTITY_A.

So an example output for a monthly time grain would be:
![example|690x285](upload://6AdGHplavgfkwAW4e7GwIbFF4EA.png)


I want to create a second metric which shows the percentage of entities, of all the entities, where the `metric_one_percentage` exceeds a certain threshold, x. 

So in essence the formula would be:
`Number of entities with a metric_one_percentage  >=  x`  **/**   `Number of entities`

However I would also like this metric to have the flexibility with the time series that `metric_one_percentage` would have, that is, I don't want to pre-define the time period for `metric_one_percentage` to be able to calculate the second metric. I would like the user to define the time grain when working in Lightdash.

In my Azure based Data Platform, I have DataDog monitoring the Azure Data Factory pipelines which trigger / orchestrate my dbt jobs.  When ADF triggers a dbt job, it waits until it completes & catches if it fails.  When a job fails, DataDog calls me out via PagerDuty for investigation.
This works well HOWEVER, sometimes I need dbt to abort a job (i.e. freshness / tests) and not execute subsequent models (to save credits) but I don't want it to trigger a call out.  Is there a way to **abort** a dbt job without triggering a **failure** ?

## The context of why I'm trying to do this
see above

## What I've already tried 
I can't see an option to stop a job other than a model failing...

I am planning to use dbt_expectations package to do data quality checks in Big query using dbt.
After defining data quality checks in schema.yaml , when I run DBT TEST, it’s showing failures on console.  

1. Is there any way to call  dbt_expectations macros in dbt models? (Like normal function calls in each model instead of defining in schema. Yaml) 
2. If I use dbt test , how to capture passed and failures report on Big query for each column level?

1. I didn't understand why it is bad for you to define the tests in the `.yml` and why would it be better to call a macro in the `.sql`. Anyway, as they are tests, I think you can only define them in the `.yml`.

I need to create a job that generates views based on data from Snowflake information schema.

example: 
1st step
select table_name from old_db.information_schema.tables

How are these variants of the model different from one another? Why do they need to be two different queries going into the same table? 

The standard way to do this in dbt would be to have each model do a single thing, and then have another model which is the union of those two tables. Even that might not be necessary though depending on what your goal is - maybe you could do it all in one model, and have an additional column on the end describing its origin

You can write the two SQL codes in the same file and use an `if` block. Then you can choose the model based on a var you can pass in the run command.

There's no difference in terms of what each of the models does but they differ in terms of when they are executed. The original model/job runs on schedule while the copy runs when needed.

For example you could add a tag and then run `dbt run --select tag:my_tag` as an adhoc job that is different to your regularly scheduled `dbt run` command.

Put another way, your proposed approach conflates the orchestration logic and the business logic of your files. You should build the models that you need to see in your database, and then attach extra metadata to them to make them runnable on the schedule you need, not have your project structure driven by your orchestration logic.",5

The way I modelled it is by creating a variable e.g. **is_daily_run** in the project.yml file and the default value is set to true which will be the case for regular run. When the variable is false, it will run as copy mode.

Now in the model, you will play with the where condition checking the value of the **is_daily_run** variable. 
```
{% if var(""is_daily_run"") == 'True' %}

          AND load_date>= last_run_date

{% else %}

The screenshot 1 failed but screenshot 2 succeed for the incremental update. cam.date is already a timestamp without timezone. It only work when I cast it into text. If I keep it as timestamp, it says

function date_add(text, bigint, timestamp without time zone) does not exist

It is really weird to me, how come the cam.date can determine whether the macro (screenshot 3) work or not? The screenshot 3&4 are the utils function I wrote for my project. In addition, this macro actually works in other models in my project where ::timestamp is completely ok. I got really confused on why it sometimes works and sometimes does not.

13:26:11  2 of 2 START sql table model xxx.model2 ... [RUN]

```


step 1  fails (the model container a syntax error `Snowflake adapter: Snowflake error: 001003 (42000): SQL compilation error: syntax error line 40`) , 

then it starts step 2 (model2) , which surprises me because I though that the --fail-fast meant that it won't continue at all. 

Then it gets stuck on CANCEL  (or maybe it's waiting for the model2 to complete, hard to tell)

Is there any way to make it fail fast for real? not starting model2 at all?",1

7101,"surfacing-data-quality-issues","Right now we have several very complex transformations and we continually get questions from end users on why a particular row of source data didn't make it through all the transformation steps into the final database tables. This is sometimes easy to answer (""some source data field was invalid"") and sometimes difficult (""at some intermediate transformation step a particular join condition failed""). 

Our goal is to empower users to be able to see these problems themselves and not have to ask the engineering team.

We want to move our pipelines to dbt, but I am struggling to see how to implement this. tests came to mind first as you can save test failures in the database. We could build a UI on top of these tables so users could view problems. However, the downside is it seems rows that fail tests still make it through transformations. Ideally we'd be able to write some validation logic that would both record the problem in a db table for the UI as well as prevent the row from being included in the transformation.

I did see this post that seems to discuss the same issue, but it seems heavy weight for a seemingly common issue. I can't really imagine doing this for dozens of transformations.

I understand Fivetran is used for Extract and Load and dbt is used for transformation. We have license for dbt cloud and fivetran. 

Question 1 : What is the difference between using dbt transformation in fivetran and having the project in dbt cloud. How are are they different and what are the benefits and use cases?. We don't have a whole lot of documentation related to this.

Question 2 : How do we build a continuous data pipeline without having any data orchestration tools. is there is a way to call fivetran connectors from dbt or call dbt jobs immediately after fivetran data sync?  

Question 3 : Using Fivetran and dbt is more of a ELT model. Is there is a way to design a ETL model with these tools? what i'm trying to understand is to extract data using fivetran and transform the data using dbt without loading the data to destination and then load the curated data to destination from dbt.

The incremental materialization has a setting called `on_schema_change`.
https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models#what-if-the-columns-of-my-incremental-model-change

From the docs:
"" The possible values for `on_schema_change` are:

* `ignore`: Default behavior (see below).
* `fail`: Triggers an error message when the source and target schemas diverge
* `append_new_columns`: Append new columns to the existing table. Note that this setting does *not* remove columns from the existing table that are not present in the new data.
* `sync_all_columns`: Adds any new columns to the existing table, and removes any columns that are now missing. Note that this is *inclusive* of data type changes. On BigQuery, changing column types requires a full [table](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/table) scan; be mindful of the trade-offs when implementing.""""

So if you want to see your new column you can use `append_new_columns` or `sync_all_columns`.

But notice this will not backfill the data for your new column. If you want to populate your new column with historical data you need to run the model in` full-refresh` mode",2

I am creating some views on redshift using dbt. One of the in particular controls the row level access per user, so all models are ultimately joined with it. But it still is just a view definition, there are no tables in the mix.

Every single time dbt tries to update this view, if there are any queries at that time that involve that view (which is often, since this is a client facing database), it deadlocks.

By that I mean - dbt is not able to re-create the view, no one is able to query it, and this situations persists until dbt's process is manually killed.

It seems to me that even if the view is under use, as long as there are a few seconds of downtime (which there are), then dbt should do its job and no deadlock should occur.

What I've tried so far:
* decreasing number of threads to 1
* running during a time when there is no more DB activity (this works without a problem)

7231,"speedup-merge-strategy-with-custom-incremental-predicate","Hi everyone,

I would like to share the solution to speedup the merge operation, highly inspired by [this thread](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/6658). The solution is to customize the `incremental_predicates` when using `incremental_strategy='merge'`. The idea is to pre-filter the partitions of the destination table before merging based dynamically on the values of the update. In my case, I noticed a 30% speedup when merging 100k rows into 1.4B rows (this number depends on the actual distribution of your data).


Now the nitty gritty details:

1/ in it's [native form with v1.4](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models#about-incremental_predicates), you can add the option `incremental_predicates` to filter the destination table in the config block. However, you can only add a static value. In other words, the filter cannot depend dynamically on the actual values of your update. Subqueries are not allowed, nor using variables, nor any jinja templating. In other words, the SQL command is not evaluated before runtime.

2/ to customize the behavior of `incremental_predicates`, you need to define the `get_merge_sql` macro which reads the values in your update, then add a predicate filter on the partition keys. The latter point is important since it will force dbt to skip the partitions. Otherwise, it will still scan the whole table.

caveat: I have not found a solution yet to make the macro adaptive to any situation. At the moment, I have defined an if statement each time I want to use a predicate for a different model.

Please find below a reproducible code. Let's assume that the source `mysource.yml` contains the following:

```yaml
- name: mytable
  columns:
    - name: id #primary key on which to perform the merge operation.
    - name: day #the partition key
    - name: myvalue #some data
    - name: _processing_time #how to filter between incremental updates
```

The model `mymodel.sql` using the custom `incremental_predicates`:

```
{{ 
    config (
        materialized=""incremental"",
        incremental_strategy='merge',
        file_format='delta',
        unique_key='id',
        partition_by=[""day""],
        incremental_predicates=[""custom_day""]
    )
}}

SELECT
    id, 
    day, 
    myvalue, 
   _processing_time
FROM {{ source('mysource', 'mytable') }} AS s
{% if is_incremental() %}
    WHERE s._processing_time > (select MAX(_processing_time) from {{ this }})
{% endif %}
```

The `get_merge_sql` macro:

```
{% macro get_merge_sql(target, source, unique_key, dest_columns, incremental_predicates) -%}
    {% set predicate_override = """" %}
      {% if incremental_predicates[0] == ""custom_day"" %}
        {% set get_limits_query %}
            SELECT
                MIN(day) AS min_day,
                MAX(day) AS max_day
            FROM {{ source }}
        {% endset %}
        {% set limits = run_query(get_limits_query)[0] %}
        {% set min_day, max_day = limits[0], limits[1] %}

        {% set predicate_override %}
            DBT_INTERNAL_DEST.day >= '{{ min_day }}'
            AND DBT_INTERNAL_DEST.day <= '{{ max_day }}'
        {% endset %}
    {% endif %}
    {% set predicates = [predicate_override] if predicate_override else incremental_predicates %}
    -- standard merge from here
    {% set merge_sql = dbt.get_merge_sql(target, source, unique_key, dest_columns, predicates) %}
    {{ return(merge_sql) }}

{% endmacro %}
```

Here are the steps to reproduce the behavior:
1/ create mytable with the SQL script (databricks):

```sql
CREATE TABLE mytable (id int, day date, myvalue int, _processing_time timestamp);

INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (1, '2023-01-01', 10, current_timestamp());
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (2, '2023-01-01', 20, current_timestamp());
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (3, '2023-01-02', 30, current_timestamp());
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (4, '2023-01-03', 40, current_timestamp());
```
2/ `$ dbt run --full-refresh --select mymodel`
3/ add a new row to the source table:

```sql
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (5, '2023-01-04', 50, current_timestamp());
```
4/ simulate the upsert with `$ dbt run --select mymodel`. If you have used a SQL warehouse, you should get in the query profile 'files pruned = 3', ie the merge should have skipped the existing partitions.",1

I had to make a workaround multiplying from the left side in order to make it work.

The context of why I'm trying to do this:
An NPS calculation which is an operation like this (A+B)/C * 100. This should return the result of the division * 100. But the 100 is calculated before the division occurs, so it returns (A+B) / (100 C).

Quantity
8

{{ config(materialized='table') }}

SELECT
    product_id,
    event_timestamp,
    quantity

  (1, TIMESTAMP '2022-01-03', 10)
AS 
  t(product_id, event_timestamp, quantity)

{{ config(
        materialized = 'incremental',
        unique_key = 'product_id',
        incremental_strategy='merge',

It occured to me that rather than representing a dashboard in dbt as an exposure, it might be possible to represent them as a Python model.  I haven't tested this theory, but hypothetically, could you...

1. Create a python model that correlates to a Power BI dashboard
2. Within the model, make an API call to the Power BI service to refresh the dashboard
3. Make some kind of dummy references to dependencies, so these are captured in the DAG
4. Any response from the API could be captured and returned as the model output -- effectively acting as a log

a question on using dbt as data ingestion tool (with the incremental model)

i am trying to find out the pros & cons using 1) dbt incremental model to bring data from or production database under GCP cloud SQL into BigQuery vs 2) using GCP datastream to bring data directly from the production database into BigQuery

if the production database is hosted under GCP cloud SQL, BigQuery can query the production db directly via the 'EXTERNAL_QUERY()' feature. as such, one in theory can build an incremental model in dbt with syntax 'select * from external_query(<hosting area>, 'select * from production db table name') to bring incremental changes from the prod db.

You could instead use dbt Cloud for your orchestration, and either use its built-in scheduler (no GHA at all) or trigger a DBT Cloud run from a GHA instead (you would still need to provide a dbt Cloud API key to GitHub, but it wouldn't be your database credentials which might be preferable).

## The problem I'm having
Trying to build model and have dynamic variable - today date as string (YYYY-MM-DD)

## The context of why I'm trying to do this
Need to have models with historical date filter and current date filters.

## What I've already tried 
```dbt run --select +model --vars '{""key"": ""value"", ""current_date"": ""now().date()""}'```
```dbt run --select +model --vars '{""key"": ""value"", ""current_date"": ""{{ macros.date() }}'```

## Works manually
```dbt run --select +model --vars '{""key"": ""value"", ""current_date"": ""2023-03-13""}'```

## Solution
In BigQuery you can use ```current_date()``` function to get YYYY-MM-DD date.
In SQL you can use ```now().date()```

SETUP:
dbt_project.yml var:
```current_date: current_date: ""'2022-12-31'""```

macro:
```where transaction_date <= {{current_date}}```

model sql:
```
with model as ( 
    {{ macro_with_filter(current_date=var('current_date')) }}
)

select * from model
```

This setup will for for CLI's:
```
dbt run --select model_name 
dbt run --select model_name --vars '{""key"": ""value"", ""current_date"": ""current_date()""}'
```",1

Is this expected behavior? If not, are there any suggestions on how to close the gap?

DBT version is 1.4.5 and warehouse is Snowflake. The files on either side of the gap are base staging with ephemeral materialization. Thank you.

It's great to re-use existing models but scheduling jobs efficiently is becoming a challenge. Currently, we have jobs to build ""core"" models  like this: dbt run --select +mart_1+.

The problem is that a dependency for mart_1 can also be a dependency for mart_2. Mart_1 and mart_2 only really have 1 common table. If we schedule mart_2 as dbt run --select +mart_2+ then both lineage paths get run entirely. I really only want to run each model distinctly once, but in order of their dependencies.

My thought was to indicate to dbt that I want to only run models N times per day (once in this case). If a job triggers that model to run a second time, skip it and move to the next model. Is there a mechanism to do this or a more elegant way to solve the problem?

If so, and your model is just a select star with a single filter, I would rather use the SQL code in the models, as it makes them more readable, and you don't need to worry about vars.

I'd like to find out if anyone has managed to get dbt working with against Synapse Spark?

I've manged to create a test project which I have configured against Databricks and Synapse Dedicated pool, but I'm wondering if it is even possible to use Synapse Spark as a transformation engine using dbt.

I have created a database with external tables over my parquet\delta sources, but it seems to me that:

(1) the SQL functionality of Synapse's Spark implementation is too limited
(2) it may not be possible to configure dbt to access Synapse Spark as an end-point.

Any thoughts?

7412,"fivetran-how-to-run-models-frequently-enough-but-not-too-frequently","## The problem I'm having
We're hitting our database (Snowflake) far harder now that we've switched to dbt, resulting in extreme costs.
By default, Fivetran puts the `+` operator to the left of our model names so as to run upstream models as well. We need this in order to ensure dependencies are refreshed first.

This creates two problems:
1. We're re-running heavy models that are commonly hit. For example, we may have a heavy sales model that combines data from three tables into one denormalized table. This should only be run daily. But because our hourly models depend on it, they end up triggering it to be re-run every hour.
2. We're needlessly re-creating 1000+ views in our staging layer repeatedly throughout the day. Because every model at some point relies on a staging model, the staging model gets re-run many many times throughout the day. These staging models are simply views with very light transformations, so each one takes very little time. That said, due to the number of them, it becomes a problem. It creates no value for us to recreate these views, because their definitions are always the same (and since they're views, their data is also always the same).

## The context of why I'm trying to do this
We use the `+` operator in front of our models because most of our models require at least 2-3 other models before finally coming together in a ""final"" or ""output"" model.

## What I've already tried 
The only thing I can really think to do is to change from `ref()` to `source()` wherever we're hitting something we don't want to re-run frequently. But that feels inconsistent with dbt's purpose and we therefore lose a lot of advantages of dbt by so doing.

I considered trying to put the `+` operator after more upstream models, but that won't necessarily guarantee everything necessary gets run.

How do others do this with Fivetran? Even if we ignore the first part, how do others have a staging layer that isn't constantly getting re-created for no reason?

I've tried looking at yaml selectors and applying a default property, but the docs state  that they only apply on an ""unqualified"" command and will be ignored if any selectors are embedded in the command (which Fivetran always does).

For further context, Fivetran's logs show that it always executes a command like the following:
`dbt run --models +model_1 +model_2 +model_7`",1

I haven't used it (obviously we use dbt Cloud internally as well as at my last company, which has full control over the DAG selection when you configure a job), but at a guess: are you able to control the selectors at all, e.g. by managing the job as code instead?",2

We can switch to their ""Scheduled in Code"" version, which I'm going to try today. That's the only way we can control the selectors.

I'm curious, though, what the best practice is to prevent re-running our staging layer, for example, every time even using selectors. Would we just always append something like --exclude staging on every single command?",3

As you were already advised to gain full control over selectors you might switch to ""Scheduled in Code"" transformations, but you also have an option to run your intermediate models with ""Partially integrated"" schedule.

7412,"fivetran-how-to-run-models-frequently-enough-but-not-too-frequently","Thanks for the idea.
Before I create a ticket to pursue this, I want to clarify: You're saying that if I put an intermediate model on a ""Partially Integrated"" schedule, that other models in ""Fully Integrated"" mode which are dependent on this intermediate model will skip it when they execute?",6
7412,"fivetran-how-to-run-models-frequently-enough-but-not-too-frequently","I'm trying to work out the best way to do this using YAML Selectors.

I notice in [the docs that it says](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/yaml-selectors#exclude):
> exclude ... is always applied last within its scope.

Let's say I have the following lineage for an output model used by a Tableau report:
```
inventory --------------------->
int_products_enhanced --------->
                                 --> rpt_tableau
sales ------------------------->
```

And the following lineage used by my sales model:
```
int_products_enhanced ----->
stg_brick_mortar_sales ---->
                             ---> sales
stg_ecommerce_sales ------->
```

You'll notice that `int_products_enhanced` is used in both transformations.
The `sales` model, along with all it's parents, is the heavy model I want to exclude (which I run daily).

That said, because the lineage for the `rpt_tableau` model also directly references `int_products_enhanced`, I do want `int_products_enhanced` to be re-run when `rpt_tableau` and it's parents are run.

Given that exclude selectors apply last and the following selectors.yml, `int_products_enhanced` doesn't get re-run. Suggestions on how I could alter it so that it does get re-run due to it's being directly referenced by `rpt_tableau`?

I would like to configure DBT tests on my sources like this for [example](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/configs-and-properties#example) and use DBT build to skip downstream (reliant) models using the native [skip on failure](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/build#details) from DBT build. The skip on failure works great for tests on models and it's downstream models, but I haven't been able to consistently reproduce the same effect with tests on sources.

2. Use source() function in your dbt model, it compiles to the full object name in the database.

src_view.yml
```
version: 2

sources:
  - name: function_source_name# this is the source_name
    database: function_project_id 
    schema: function_dataset_id
    tables:
      - name: function_name # this is the your function_name
```

SELECT
col1,
col2,

FROM table

7426,"how-to-get-upstream-documentation-to-flow-downstream-without-manually-updating","Hi, I'm trying to create column-level documentation for staging models and would like to see that documentation populated downstream in later models when those columns are brought in using the ref() function with a documented staging model. I don't see an automatic feature that does that currently within DBT.  
ex: stg_model_a is fully documented. int_model_abc brings in stg_model_a. When I create documentation for int_model_abc, I would like any documentation from stg_model_a to be brought into int_model_abc without any manual effort.

I know that I could use the Codegen macro with the upstream_documentation configuration but that would still require me to populate that, copy that information, and update the YAML file. This is quite manual, and if upstream columns are changed, this would need to be done for all downstream models. 

Is there a way to have DBT do the heavy lifting for this?",1

Let's say I have the following lineage for an output model used by a Tableau report:
```
inventory --------------------->
int_products_enhanced --------->
                                 --> rpt_tableau
sales ------------------------->

And the following lineage used by my sales model:
```
int_products_enhanced ----->
stg_brick_mortar_sales ---->
                             ---> sales
stg_ecommerce_sales ------->
```

You'll notice that `int_products_enhanced` is used in both transformations.
The `sales` model, along with all it's parents, is a heavy model I want to exclude from hourly runs (because I run the `sales` model daily).

That said, because the lineage for the `rpt_tableau` model also directly references `int_products_enhanced`, I do want `int_products_enhanced` to be re-run when `rpt_tableau` and it's parents are run.

Given that exclude selectors apply last and the following selectors.yml, `int_products_enhanced` doesn't get re-run. Suggestions on how I could alter it so that it does get re-run due to it's being directly referenced by `rpt_tableau`?

This is what `dbt build` does. When the model is built, it runs any tests attached to it.

Are you saying this is what you think happens, or what you *want* to happen? If a logic error is detected by a model's test, then models that depend on the first model will not run, and the whole job *will* have an error event (when everything else has completed). 

If you want the job to not fire an error event when it encounters an error, that is not possible.

1. First lets generate a `manifest.json` of a production run - which will be deferred to later in our subsequent ci run. Be sure to move the generate artifacts to it's own folder as well.

```sh
$ dbt ls --target prod
my_dbt_project.bar_1
my_dbt_project.bar_2
my_dbt_project.foo_1
my_dbt_project.foo_2
source:my_dbt_project.company_foo.users
$ mv target target_old
```

> Some users do `dbt compile` instead which works too. Most commonly, this would be `dbt run` as production jobs are meant to be building models. In special circumstances do users want the job being deferred to to be an `ls` or `compile` job.

2. Now let's modify our model `bar_1.sql` but not anything else.

```sql
-- models/bar_1.sql
select 2 as id
```

3. Let's do a run with state deferral.

Here - there is no confusion - we modified model `bar_1` and indeed it was the only one that was changed. 

4. Most of the time though, we also want to run models that are downstream since changes to `bar_1`, could also affect `bar_2` - and to do this, we add a plus (`+`) to our selector.  Let's try that:

Now, many more models have been executed. For `bar_2` - it's not surprising since `bar_2` is directly downstream of `bar_1`. But why `foo_1` (and subsequently `foo_2`)? Well, that's due to how we've defined our source which `foo_1` uses - recall:

```yaml
# models/sources.yml
version: 2
sources:
  - name: company_foo
    database: '{{ ""development"" if target.name == ""prod"" else ""development_jyeo"" }}'
    tables:
      - name: users
```

In our production job (target == 'prod'), the source evaluated to `development.company_foo.users` but in our ci job (target == 'ci'), the source is instead `development_jyeo.company_foo.users` - this means that YES, the source is detected as being modified. But of course, even if a source is modified, `run -s state:modifed` doesn't actually do ANYTHING to sources (since sources are not run). But as soon as we do `run -s state:modified+` - we would be ""running"" things that are downstream of the changed source - which is of course `foo_1` (and `foo_2` by extension).

The issue I am having is, whenever I build my custom tests, I get an error. After inspecting the target code, it looks like the FROM is never being populated.

I even tried using code from the documentation and that fails to build as well. I am curious if this is a bug or if am I missing something obvious.

Here is the test code:

```
{% test Currency(model, column_name) %}

    SELECT *
    FROM {{ model }}
    WHERE NOT REGEXP_LIKE({{ column_name }}, '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]{1,2})?$')

All it does is figure out if the value is a valid currency.

The compiled code looks like this:
```
select
      count(*) as failures,
      count(*) != 0 as should_warn,
      count(*) != 0 as should_error
    from (

I am using incremental models to create the ""intermediate"" level of my data, as the raw data is JSON based, I want to extract the keys that I need, and populate a table that will be relational.
To avoid going over the entire dataset every time, we decided to use Incremental models, with merge strategy, and a ""on_schema_change=append_new_columns"" approach.

Once we started using the models, we noticed that dbt creates ""temporary"" tables for the data that needs to be merged, with a lifetime of 12 hours. However, as we run our transformations about every 30 minutes, these tables are always present in our BigQuery project.

We do want to keep using the incremental strategy, and appending new columns, but according to [this git issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/issues/184), it seems that we might be able to resolve it if we change the on_schema_change to a different value.

Since the data is mostly filtered down and is not too large, we don't mind about the storage costs - but we do mind that there are x2 more tables in our project, since for every incremental model we made, we now have the output table X and also the temporary table X__dbt_tmp

## The problem I'm having
When adding two entries of macros in `property.yml`, `dbt compile` has the following complain:
```sh
02:17:51  Encountered an error:
Compilation Error
  dbt found two macros named ""macro2"" in the project ""xxx"".
   To fix this error, rename or remove one of the following macros:
      - macros/utils/a_file_with_2_macros_defined.sql
      - macros/utils/a_file_with_2_macros_defined.sql
```

## The context of why I'm trying to do this
Initially there was only 1 macro `macro1` defined in `macros/utils/a_file_with_2_macros_defined.sql` and the `property.yml` is like below and everything works just fine.
```yaml
version: 2

macros:
  - name: macro1
    description: """"
    arguments: """"
```
Then I added an additional macro `macro2` to the same `sql` file and the `property.yml` file is changed to something below. But `dbt compile` starts to pop up the complains. If I remove the entry from `property.yml` file, everything works just fine and the data model consuming the new macro also works fine. 

Anyone has any clue on what's going on here? I'm pretty sure I don't have two macros with the same name in my project. 
```yaml
version: 2

macros:
  - name: macro1

One question: you said in the post 
>if [...] while in debug mode you press `c`, the debugger will stop at each of your breakpoints

Does this mean that a `{{ debug() }}` call very early on in your file would be almost impossible to trigger? I can understand how enough time would pass to trigger the breakpoint if you're trying to capture something that happens in an `on-run-end` hook, but what about if you were debugging something in `on-run-start`? 

Or are you also allowed to press `c` while dbt is doing the initial parse work etc, which means that you don't need the quickest draw in the west to make it work?",2

`c` stands for `continue`, e.g. continue from the current breakpoint until the next one (or until the end of the program).

So you don't need to type `c` to trigger the first breakpoint, it will happen automatically (and you wont't need the quickest draw in the west). If you have multiple breakpoints though, after you enter the first one you might want to type `c` to execute all the code until the next one.",4

Here is an example in Python . I need to implement in dbt

import phonenumbers

my_number = phonenumbers.parse(""0721234567"", ""RO"")
e164_f=phonenumbers.format_number(my_number, phonenumbers.PhoneNumberFormat.E164)
print(e164_f)",5
7586,"i-am-trying-to-convert-phone-numbers-to-e-164-format","Ok, this is what I thought, you can give your opinion about that:

**Assumptions:**
- Your columns are called  `phone_number` and `country`
- The columns are of type `string`
- The steps to transform a string into a e.164 phone number format are:
1 - Remove all non-numeric characters from `phone_number`
2 - Remove leading zeros from `phone_number`
3 - Check if the country code is included, if it is not, include it
4 - Include a plus sign at the end

**My solution:**

Create a macro in `macros/` folder with this SQL code:

```sql
{% macro country_code(country) %}

    case
        when trim(lower({{ country }})) = ""germany"" then ""49""
        when trim(lower({{ country }})) = ""france"" then ""33""
    end

{% endmacro %}


{% macro e164(phone_number, country) %}

  case
      when
         left(
              ltrim(
                regexp_replace(
                    {{ phone_number }}, '[^0-9]+', ''
                ), '0'
              )
              , length(
                  {{ country_code(country) }}
              )
          ) = {{ country_code(country) }}
      then
          concat(
              '+'
              , ltrim(
                  regexp_replace(
                      {{ phone_number }}, '[^0-9]+', ''
                  ), '0'
              )
          )
      else
          concat(
              '+'
              , {{ country_code(country) }}
              , ltrim(
                  regexp_replace(
                      {{ phone_number }}, '[^0-9]+', ''
                  )
                  , '0'
              )
          )
      end

{% endmacro %}
```

Then in your model you can do something like

```sql
select
    some_id
    , some_column
    ,  {{ e164('phone_number', 'country') }} as e164_phone_number
from your_model
```

**What you have to know**
- These functions work for **BigQuery**, if you are using another DB, then maybe you will have to adapt the functions
- I didn't care for performance, just wrote some idea, so it is **not optimized**, but you can work on that
- In this solution, you must **manually input the countries' codes in a case when statement**. Maybe using a dictionary is better suited? Don't know

7610,"dbt-bigquery-table-creation-code-generation-issue","Hi experts,

I have been using DBT for BigQuery table creation and transformation but it has been constantly giving me query errors that it generates.

Here is what the model looks like, this is to imitate BQ's WRITE_TRUNCATE on partition column `submit_date`.

```
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental',
        incremental_strategy='insert_overwrite',
        on_schema_change='sync_all_columns',
        partition_by = {
            'field': 'submit_date',
            'data_type': 'date',
            'granularity': 'day'
        },
        require_partition_filter = true,
        database='db',
        schema='dataset',
        alias='my_table_forge'
    )
}}
-- An ordinary SELECT
```

DBT then somehow generates two queries, one is to create a temp table and the other is to create the real table. The first query fires off perfectly fine with no error, but what is really weird is the second query:

```
create or replace table `db`.`dataset`.`my_table_forge`
partition by submit_date

OPTIONS(
require_partition_filter=True
)
as (

select col1, col2, col3...
from `db`.`dataset`.`my_table_forge`);
```

This hits an error:
```
Cannot query over table 'db.dataset.my_table_forge' without a filter over column(s) 'submit_date' that can be used for partition elimination
```

Why would dbt use the table to create itself? Shouldn't it query from the temp table and dump data into the real table? And even if it makes sense, somehow, it is ignoring the partition_field `submit_date`.

Any idea how to fix it?",1

If it does not work I am not sure what the problem is, but you can try to use a solution a community member (@johanndw) has come up with.

I will paste his message here:

""Related note, BQ does not perform partition elimination when using a subquery in the where clause. We use a macro to derive the highwater mark and pass that to the where clause as a literal value. This will probably also have solved your issue which requires a literal value, bonus is that BQ can perform partition elimination as well
```
{% macro get_incremental_filter(model, column, filter) %}

{% set max_query %}
    select coalesce(max(timestamp( {{column}} )), timestamp('1900-01-01')) as max_timevalue 
    from {{ model }}
    {% if filter is defined %}
        where {{ filter }}
    {% endif %}
{% endset %}

{% set max_query_results = run_query(max_query) %}

{% if execute %}
    {% set max_timestamp = max_query_results.rows[0].values()[0] %}
    {% if max_timestamp is none %}
        {{ exceptions.raise_compiler_error('max_timestamp returned from ""get_incremental_filter"" macro is None') }}

    {% set max_timestamp = max_timestamp | string %}

{% endif %}

{{ log('Incremental filter for ' ~ model ~ ' is ' ~ max_timestamp) }} {# log incremental filter #}

And then in the models

When you execute a command such as  `dbt run`,  the models will be run in the DAGs order, and dbt knows this order because of the `{{ ref() }}` and `{{ source() }}` jinja functions. The name of the files and folders will not impact the order of processing, the resources are related through ref and source. (you other particularities with tests and exposures)

The name and placing conventions are used to make your project more understandable and consistent. And also to allow you to easily select a group of models in your command using selector syntax.

> **Folders.** Folder structure is extremely important in dbt. Not only do we need a consistent structure to find our way around the codebase, as with any software project, but our folder structure is also one of the key interfaces for understanding the knowledge graph encoded in our project (alongside the DAG and the data output into our warehouse). It should reflect how the data flows, step-by-step, from a wide variety of source-conformed models into fewer, richer business-conformed models. Moreover, we can use our folder structure as a means of selection in dbt [selector syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax).

> **File names.** Creating a consistent pattern of file naming is [crucial in dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/on-the-importance-of-naming). File names must be unique and correspond to the name of the model when selected and created in the warehouse. We recommend putting as much clear information into the file name as possible, including a prefix for the layer the model exists in, important grouping information, and specific information about the entity or transformation in the model.

Your explicit reply regarding 
1. the order of processing with regard to the `{{ ref() }}` and `{{ source() }}` jinja functions,
2. the impact of folder structuring and file naming,
is helpful.

I agree that logical folder structuring and naming conventions are important for good project management. Also important is distinguishing between how data/files are processed from logical file organization, otherwise, an important fundamental understanding of dbt is missing.

For further clarification, and to confirm your reply and citation links: 

A.
i. What about the folder structure at the level of models and tests? 
Do those folder naming conventions impact processing?
ii. If I created and used a folder named 'design' instead of 'models', would processing still be the same?
Is that determined by the 'model-paths: [""models""]' setting in dbt_project.yml?
iii. If I included staging files in the tests folder, would they still process properly for staging as long as the appropriate `{{ ref() }}` and `{{ source() }}` jinja functions were included?
Is that related to the 'test-paths: [""tests""]' setting in dbt_project.yml?

B. 
i. Would naming a folder in models to 'stg' instead of 'staging' and prefixing the files inside with 'stage_' instead of 'stg_' work the same as long as the `{{ ref() }}` and `{{ source() }}` jinja functions are appropriately the same?

dbt will try to find each type of resource in their respective folders, according to the paths you specify in dbt_project.yml. If you do not specify anything it will search for the default ones.

Your models must be inside the `models` folder unless you specify another folder in `model-paths` as you said. If you want them to be inside a `design` folder you can specify it in the paths.

I have never tried to pass the tests folder in the `model-paths` and put a model inside it. It might work, not sure. For learning purposes, you can try it, just have in mind that it was not how it was supposed to be structured.

No problem doing that. You can name the subfolders inside your `models` folder, and the models inside as you want. It will work the same.

## Some example code or error messages
Here I'm not sure how to define grain properly as I assume it will calculate count of distinct user_id within the week, month but I would actually need it to consider the end dates of each period as well.

Hi,

We're working on a project that involves training a predictive machine learning model in Snowflake. We create our training dataset by transforming raw data with SQL in dbt, and then want to 

1) train an ML model on this dataset and save the model, e.g. as a pickle file
2) separately, load the model and make predictions 

We know it's possible to run Python with dbt, and we've successfully trained the model in dbt. In terms of storing objects, we can think of using 

- Snowflake internal stages
- External stages, such as S3 

We'd be eager to understand whether there are any best practices for running SQL + Python workloads in Snowflake involving saving and then loading in machine learning models?

You don't need to keep the headers, but try to hit these points in your question: -->

## The problem I'm having
We’ve seen in the “incremental models” where the date field’s degree of detail drops to lower levels like minutes or seconds, a data problem may occur where incorrect data persists in production on future reloads/backfills from the same period of time. To make it simpler to describe what I am observing, I will do so using the following example at the day level.
We have the current model:

```
{{config(
  materialized='incremental',
  incremental_strategy='delete+insert',
  unique_key='date_day',
)}}

select date('2023-01-01') as date_day
UNION 
select date('2023-01-02') as date_day
UNION 
select date('2023-01-03') as date_day
UNION 
select date('2023-01-04') as date_day
UNION 
select date('2023-01-05') as date_day
UNION 
select date('2023-01-06') as date_day
```

I executed it the first time, and the table was created. If I execute it more times, what the model is doing is:

```
CREATE TEMP_TABLE AS CTE;

DELETE FROM FINAL_TABLE WHERE date_day in (SELECT date_day from TEMP_TABLE);

INSERT INTO FINAL_TABLE SELECT * FROM TEMP_TABLE;
```

Let’s imagine that we are doing a backfill of the data and this `data_day = 2023-01-03` we don’t have data. Then after executing the following code:
```
{{config(
  materialized='incremental',
  incremental_strategy='delete+insert',
  unique_key='date_day'
)}}

select date('2023-01-01') as date_day
UNION
select date('2023-01-02') as date_day
UNION
select date('2023-01-04') as date_day
UNION
select date('2023-01-05') as date_day
UNION
select date('2023-01-06') as date_day
```
We will find that `2023-01-03` persist in the final table.
The problem comes from the `DELETE` command that is not built as a range of dates.
```
DELETE FROM FINAL_TABLE
WHERE date_day >= (SELECT min(date_date) FROM TEMP_TABLE)
  and date_day <= (SELECT max(date_date) FROM TEMP_TABLE)
```
## The context of why I'm trying to do this
We have some cases where date_key is hours or minutes and this is a case that can happen with some data
## What I've already tried 
I look for a solution of incremental materialization and delete_strategy equal delete+insert, but I did not find anything.The only solution was to aggregate a pre_hook, but it means that we need to know before hand the `min` an `max` date that is going to be load in the final table.
```
{{config(
  materialized='incremental',
  incremental_strategy='delete+insert',
  unique_key='date_day',
  pre_hook=""
  {% if is_incremental() %}
    delete from {{ this }} where date_day between date('2023-01-02') and date('2023-01-06')
  {% endif %}""
)}}
```
The same happens with incremental_strategy=‘merge’

I'm unable to use Python models with dbt-core. I run into a a SSL certificate verify failure when communicating with my Databricks instance. SQL models work fine.

## What I've already tried 
- Creating simple Python models (doesn't work)
- Creating  SQL models (does work)
- Disabling ssl_verify on my conda configuration file

## Some example code or error messages
HTTPSConnectionPool(host='<databricks_domain>', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/1.2/contexts/create (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1129)')))",1
